know her father  though know not her  and he knew my deceased father well  will not sleep  hortensio  till see her  and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter  unless you will accompany me thither  pray you  sir  let him go while the humour lasts  o  my word  an she knew him as well as do  she would think scolding would do little good upon him  she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so  why  that s nothing  an he begin once  he ll rail in his rope tricks  i ll tell you what sir  an she stand him but a little  he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat  you know him not  sir  tarry  petruchio  must go with thee  for in baptista s keep my treasure is  he hath the jewel of my life in hold  his youngest daughter  beautiful binaca  and her withholds from me and other more  suitors to her and rivals in my love  supposing it a thing impossible  for those defects have before rehearsed  that ever katharina will be woo d  therefore this order hath baptista ta en  that none shall have access unto bianca till katharina the curst have got a husband  katharina the curst  title for a maid of all titles the worst  now shall my friend petruchio do me grace  and offer me disguised in sober robes to old baptista as a schoolmaster well seen in music  to

wife  they sit conferring by the parlor fire  go fetch them hither  if they deny to come  swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands  away  say  and bring them hither straight  exit here is a wonder  if you talk of a wonder  and so it is  wonder what it bodes  marry  peace it bodes  and love and quiet life  and awful rule and right supremacy  and  to be short  what not  that s sweet and happy  now  fair befal thee  good petruchio  the wager thou hast won  and will add unto their losses twenty thousand crowns  another dowry to another daughter  for she is changed  as she had never been  nay  will win my wager better yet and show more sign of her obedience  her new built virtue and obedience  see where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion  re enter with and widow katharina  that cap of yours becomes you not  off with that bauble  throw it under foot  widow lord  let me never have a cause to sigh  till be brought to such a silly pass  fie  what a foolish duty call you this  would your duty were as foolish too  the wisdom of your duty  fair bianca  hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper time  the more fool you  for laying on my duty  katharina  charge thee  tell these headstrong women what duty they do owe their lords and husbands  widow come  come  you re mocking  we will have no telling  come on  say  and first begin with her  widow she shall not  say she shall  and first begin with her  fie  fie  unknit that threatening unkind brow  and dart not scornful glances from those eyes  to wound thy lord  thy king  thy governor  it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads  confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds  and in no sense is meet or amiable  woman moved is like a fountain troubled  muddy  ill seeming  thick  bereft of beauty  and while it is so  none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it  thy husband is thy lord  thy life  thy keeper  thy head  thy sovereign  one that cares for thee  and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land  to watch the night in storms  the day in cold  whilst thou liest warm at home  secure and safe  and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love  fair looks and true obedience  too little payment for so great a debt  such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband  and when she is froward  peevish  sullen  sour  and not obedient to his honest will  what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord  am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace  or seek for rule  supremacy and sway  when they are bound to serve  love and obey  why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth  unapt to toil and trouble in the world  but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts  come  come  you froward and unable worms  my mind hath been as big as one of yours  my heart as great  my reason haply more  to bandy word for word and frown for frown  but now see our lances are but straws  our strength as weak  our weakness past compare  that seeming to be most which we indeed least are  then vail your stomachs  for it is no boot  and place your hands below your husband s foot  in token of which duty  if he please  my hand is ready  may it do him ease  why  there s a wench  come on  and kiss me  kate  well  go thy ways  old lad  for thou shalt ha t   tis a good hearing when children are toward  but a harsh hearing when women are froward  come  kate  we ll to bed  we three are married  but you two are sped  to  twas won the wager  though you hit the white  and  being a winner  god give you good night  exeunt and now  go thy ways  thou hast tamed a curst shrew   tis a wonder  by your leave  she will be tamed so
