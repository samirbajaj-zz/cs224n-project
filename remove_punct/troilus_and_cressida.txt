went by  queen hecuba and helen  and whither go they  up to the eastern tower  whose height commands as subject all the vale  to see the battle  hector  whose patience is  as a virtue  fix d  to day was moved  he chid andromache and struck his armourer  and  like as there were husbandry in war  before the sun rose he was harness d light  and to the field goes he  where every flower did  as a prophet  weep what it foresaw in hector s wrath  what was his cause of anger  the noise goes  this  there is among the greeks lord of trojan blood  nephew to hector  they call him ajax  good  and what of him  they say he is a very man per se  and stands alone  so do all men  unless they are drunk  sick  or have no legs  this man  lady  hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions  he is as valiant as the lion  churlish as the bear  slow as the elephant  a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly  his folly sauced with discretion  there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of  nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it  he is melancholy without cause  and merry against the hair  he hath the joints of every thing  but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty briareus  many hands and no use  or purblind argus  all eyes and no sight  but how should this man  that makes me smile  make hector angry  they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and struck him down  the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept hector fasting and waking  who comes here  madam  your uncle pandarus  enter hector s a gallant man  as may be in the world  lady  what s that  what s that  good morrow  uncle pandarus  good morrow  cousin cressid  what do you talk of  good morrow  alexander  how do you  cousin  when were you at ilium  this morning  uncle  what were you talking of when came  was hector armed and gone ere ye came to ilium  helen was not up  was she  hector was gone  but helen was not up  even so  hector was stirring early  that were we talking of  and of his anger  was he angry  so he says here  true  he was so  know the cause too  he ll lay about him to day  can tell them that  and there s troilus will not come far behind him  let them take heed of troilus  can tell them that too  what  is he angry too  who  troilus  troilus is the better man of the two  jupiter  there s no comparison  what  not between troilus and hector  do you know a man if you see him  ay  if ever saw him before and knew him  well  say troilus is troilus  then you say as say  for  am sure  he is not hector  no  nor hector is not troilus in some degrees   tis just to each of them  he is himself  himself  alas  poor troilus  would he were  so he is  condition  had gone barefoot to india  he is not hector  himself  no  he s not himself  would a  were himself  well  the gods are above  time must friend or end  well  troilus  well  would my heart were in her body  no  hector is not a better man than troilus  excuse me  he is elder  pardon me  pardon me  th  other s not come to t  you shall tell me another tale  when th  other s come to t  hector shall not have his wit this year  he shall not need it  if he have his own  nor his qualities  no matter  nor his beauty   twould not become him  his own s better  you have no judgment  niece  helen herself swore th  other day  that troilus  for a brown favour  for so  tis  must confess    not brown neither    no  but brown   faith  to say truth  brown and not brown  to say the truth  true and not true  she praised his complexion above paris  why  paris hath colour enough  so he has  then troilus should have too much  if she praised him above  his complexion is higher than his  he having colour enough  and the other higher  is too flaming a praise for a good complexion  had as lief helen s golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose  swear to you  think helen loves him better than paris  then she s a merry greek indeed  nay  am sure she does  she came to him th  other day into the compassed window   and  you know  he has not past three or four hairs on his chin    indeed  a tapster s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total  why  he is very young  and yet will he  within three pound  lift as much as his brother hector  is he so young a man and so old a lifter  but to prove to you that helen loves him  she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin   juno have mercy  how came it cloven  why  you know  tis dimpled  think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all phrygia  he smiles valiantly  does he not  yes  an  twere a cloud in autumn  why  go to  then  but to prove to you that helen loves troilus    troilus will stand to the proof  if you ll prove it so  troilus  why  he esteems her no more than esteem an addle egg  if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head  you would eat chickens i  the shell  cannot choose but laugh  to think how she tickled his chin  indeed  she has a marvellous white hand  must needs confess    without the rack  and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin  alas  poor chin  many a wart is richer  but there was such laughing  queen hecuba laughed that her eyes ran o er  with mill stones  and cassandra laughed  but there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes  did her eyes run o er too  and hector laughed  at what was all this laughing  marry  at the white hair that helen spied on troilus  chin  an t had been a green hair  should have laughed too  they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer  what was his answer  quoth she   here s but two and fifty hairs on your chin  and one of them is white  this is her question  that s true  make no question of that   two and fifty hairs  quoth he   and one white  that white hair is my father  and all the rest are his sons    jupiter   quoth she   which of these hairs is paris  my husband   the forked one   quoth he   pluck t out  and give it him   but there was such laughing  and helen so blushed  an paris so chafed  and all the rest so laughed  that it passed  so let it now  for it has been while going by  well  cousin  told you

wooing  things won are done  joy s soul lies in the doing  that she beloved knows nought that knows not this  men prize the thing ungain d more than it is  that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue  therefore this maxim out of love teach  achievement is command  ungain d  beseech  then though my heart s content firm love doth bear  nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear  exeunt the grecian camp  before agamemnon s tent  sennet  enter and others princes  what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks  the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness  cheques and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest rear d  as knots  by the conflux of meeting sap  infect the sound pine and divert his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth  nor  princes  is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years  siege yet troy walls stand  sith every action that hath gone before  whereof we have record  trial did draw bias and thwart  not answering the aim  and that unbodied figure of the thought that gave t surmised shape  why then  you princes  do you with cheeks abash d behold our works  and call them shames  which are indeed nought else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men  the fineness of which metal is not found in fortune s love  for then the bold and coward  the wise and fool  the artist and unread  the hard and soft seem all affined and kin  but  in the wind and tempest of her frown  distinction  with a broad and powerful fan  puffing at all  winnows the light away  and what hath mass or matter  by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled  with due observance of thy godlike seat  great agamemnon  nestor shall apply thy latest words  in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men  the sea being smooth  how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast  making their way with those of nobler bulk  but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis  and anon behold the strong ribb d bark through liquid mountains cut  bounding between the two moist elements  like perseus  horse  where s then the saucy boat whose weak untimber d sides but even now co rivall d greatness  either to harbour fled  or made a toast for neptune  even so doth valour s show and valour s worth divide in storms of fortune  for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger  but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks  and flies fled under shade  why  then the thing of courage as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize  and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune  agamemnon  thou great commander  nerve and bone of greece  heart of our numbers  soul and only spirit  in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up  hear what ulysses speaks  besides the applause and approbation to which  to most mighty for thy place and sway  to and thou most reverend for thy stretch d out life give to both your speeches  which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass  and such again as venerable nestor  hatch d in silver  should with a bond of air  strong as the axle tree on which heaven rides  knit all the greekish ears to his experienced tongue  yet let it please both  thou great  and wise  to hear ulysses speak  speak  prince of ithaca  and be t of less expect that matter needless  of importless burden  divide thy lips  than we are confident  when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws  we shall hear music  wit and oracle  troy  yet upon his basis  had been down  and the great hector s sword had lack d a master  but for these instances  the specialty of rule hath been neglected  and  look  how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain  so many hollow factions  when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair  what honey is expected  degree being vizarded  the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask  the heavens themselves  the planets and this centre observe degree  priority and place  insisture  course  proportion  season  form  office and custom  in all line of order  and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the other  whose medicinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil  and posts  like the commandment of a king  sans cheque to good and bad  but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander  what plagues and what portents  what mutiny  what raging of the sea  shaking of earth  commotion in the winds  frights  changes  horrors  divert and crack  rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure  when degree is shaked  which is the ladder to all high designs  then enterprise is sick  how could communities  degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities  peaceful commerce from dividable shores  the primogenitive and due of birth  prerogative of age  crowns  sceptres  laurels  but by degree  stand in authentic place  take but degree away  untune that string  and  hark  what discord follows  each thing meets in mere oppugnancy  the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe  strength should be lord of imbecility  and the rude son should strike his father dead  force should be right  or rather  right and wrong  between whose endless jar justice resides  should lose their names  and so should justice too  then every thing includes itself in power  power into will  will into appetite  and appetite  an universal wolf  so doubly seconded with will and power  must make perforce an universal prey  and last eat up himself  great agamemnon  this chaos  when degree is suffocate  follows the choking  and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward  with a purpose it hath to climb  the general s disdain d by him one step below  he by the next  that next by him beneath  so every step  exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior  grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation  and  tis this fever that keeps troy on foot  not her own sinews  to end a tale of length  troy in our weakness stands  not in her strength  most wisely hath ulysses here discover d the fever whereof all our power is sick  the nature of the sickness found  ulysses  what is the remedy  the great achilles  whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host  having his ear full of his airy fame  grows dainty of his worth  and in his tent lies mocking our designs  with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests  and with ridiculous and awkward action  which  slanderer  he imitation calls  he pageants us  sometime  great agamemnon  thy topless deputation he puts on  and  like a strutting player  whose conceit lies in his hamstring  and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound  twixt his stretch d footing and the scaffoldage    such to be pitied and o er wrested seeming he acts thy greatness in  and when he speaks   tis like a chime a mending  with terms unsquared  which  from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp d would seem hyperboles  at this fusty stuff the large achilles  on his press d bed lolling  from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause  cries  excellent   tis agamemnon just  now play me nestor  hem  and stroke thy beard  as he being drest to some oration   that s done  as near as the extremest ends of parallels  as like as vulcan and his wife  yet god achilles still cries  excellent   tis nestor right  now play him me  patroclus  arming to answer in a night alarm   and then  forsooth  the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth  to cough and spit  and  with a palsy fumbling on his gorget  shake in and out the rivet  and at this sport sir valour dies  cries  o  enough  patroclus  or give me ribs of steel  shall split all in pleasure of my spleen   and in this fashion  all our abilities  gifts  natures  shapes  severals and generals of grace exact  achievements  plots  orders  preventions  excitements to the field  or speech for truce  success or loss  what is or is not  serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes  and in the imitation of these twain   who  as ulysses says  opinion crowns with an imperial voice  many are infect  ajax is grown self will d  and bears his head in such a rein  in full as proud a place as broad achilles  keeps his tent like him  makes factious feasts  rails on our state of war  bold as an oracle  and sets thersites  slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint  to match us in comparisons with dirt  to weaken and discredit our exposure  how rank soever rounded in with danger  they tax our policy  and call it cowardice  count wisdom as no member of the war  forestall prescience  and esteem no act but that of hand  the still and mental parts  that do contrive how many hands shall strike  when fitness calls them on  and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies  weight    why  this hath not a finger s dignity  they call this bed work  mappery  closet war  so that the ram that batters down the wall  for the great swing and rudeness of his poise  they place before his hand that made the engine  or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution  let this be granted  and achilles  horse makes many thetis  sons  tucket what trumpet  look  menelaus  from troy  enter what would you  fore our tent  is this great agamemnon s tent  pray you  even this  may one  that is a herald and a prince  do a fair message to his kingly ears  with surety stronger than achilles  arm  fore all the greekish heads  which with one voice call agamemnon head and general  fair leave and large security  how may stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals  how  ay  ask  that might waken reverence  and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus  which is that god in office  guiding men  which is the high and mighty agamemnon  this trojan scorns us  or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers  courtiers as free  as debonair  unarm d  as bending angels  that s their fame in peace  but when they would seem soldiers  they have galls  good arms  strong joints  true swords  and  jove s accord  nothing so full of heart  but peace  aeneas  peace  trojan  lay thy finger on thy lips  the worthiness of praise distains his worth  if that the praised himself bring the praise forth  but what the repining enemy commends  that breath fame blows  that praise  sole sure  transcends  sir  you of troy  call you yourself aeneas  ay  greek  that is my name  what s your affair pray you  sir  pardon   tis for agamemnon s ears  he hears naught privately that comes from troy  nor from troy come not to whisper him  bring a trumpet to awake his ear  to set his sense on the attentive bent  and then to speak  speak frankly as the wind  it is not agamemnon s sleeping hour  that thou shalt know  trojan  he is awake  he tells thee so himself  trumpet  blow loud  send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents  and every greek of mettle  let him know  what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud  trumpet sounds we have  great agamemnon  here in troy prince call d hector   priam is his father    who in this dull and long continued truce is rusty grown  he bade me take a trumpet  and to this purpose speak  kings  princes  lords  if there be one among the fair st of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease  that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril  that knows his valour  and knows not his fear  that loves his mistress more than in confession  with truant vows to her own lips he loves  and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers   to him this challenge  hector  in view of trojans and of greeks  shall make it good  or do his best to do it  he hath a lady  wiser  fairer  truer  than ever greek did compass in his arms  and will to morrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy  to rouse a grecian that is true in love  if any come  hector shall honour him  if none  he ll say in troy when he retires  the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance  even so much  this shall be told our lovers  lord aeneas  if none of them have soul in such a kind  we left them all at home  but we are soldiers  and may that soldier a mere recreant prove  that means not  hath not  or is not in love  if then one is  or hath  or means to be  that one meets hector  if none else  am he  tell him of nestor  one that was a man when hector s grandsire suck d  he is old now  but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire  to answer for his love  tell him from me i ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this wither d brawn  and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world  his youth in flood  i ll prove this truth with my three drops of blood  now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth  amen  fair lord aeneas  let me touch your hand  to our pavilion shall lead you  sir  achilles shall have word of this intent  so shall each lord of greece  from tent to tent  yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe  exeunt all but and nestor  what says ulysses  have a young conception in my brain  be you my time to bring it to some shape  what is t  this  tis  blunt wedges rive hard knots  the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropp d  or  shedding  breed a nursery of like evil  to overbulk us all  well  and how  this challenge that the gallant hector sends  however it is spread in general name  relates in purpose only to achilles  the purpose is perspicuous even as substance  whose grossness little characters sum up  and  in the publication  make no strain  but that achilles  were his brain as barren as banks of libya   though  apollo knows   tis dry enough   will  with great speed of judgment  ay  with celerity  find hector s purpose pointing on him  and wake him to the answer  think you  yes   tis most meet  whom may you else oppose  that can from hector bring his honour off  if not achilles  though t be a sportful combat  yet in the trial much opinion dwells  for here the trojans taste our dear st repute with their finest palate  and trust to me  ulysses  our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action  for the success  although particular  shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general  and in such indexes  although small pricks to their subsequent volumes  there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large  it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice  being mutual act of all our souls  makes merit her election  and doth boil  as  twere from us all  a man distill d out of our virtues  who miscarrying  what heart receives from hence the conquering part  to steel a strong opinion to themselves  which entertain d  limbs are his instruments  in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs  give pardon to my speech  therefore  tis meet achilles meet not hector  let us  like merchants  show our foulest wares  and think  perchance  they ll sell  if not  the lustre of the better yet to show  shall show the better  do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet  for both our honour and our shame in this are dogg d with two strange followers  see them not with my old eyes  what are they  what glory our achilles shares from hector  were he not proud  we all should share with him  but he already is too insolent  and we were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes  should he  scape hector fair  if he were foil d  why then  we did our main opinion crush in taint of our best man  no  make a lottery  and  by device  let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector  among ourselves give him allowance for the better man  for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause  and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends  if the dull brainless ajax come safe off  we ll dress him up in voices  if he fail  yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men  but  hit or miss  our project s life this shape of sense assumes  ajax employ d plucks down achilles  plumes  ulysses  now begin to relish thy advice  and will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon  go we to him straight  two curs shall tame each other  pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on  as  twere their bone  exeunt part of the grecian camp  enter and thersites  agamemnon  how if he had boils  full  all

grumblest and railest every hour on achilles  and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpine s beauty  ay  that thou barkest at him  mistress thersites  thou shouldest strike him  cobloaf  he would pun thee into shivers with his fist  as a sailor breaks a biscuit  beating him you whoreson cur  do  do  thou stool for a witch  ay  do  do  thou sodden witted lord  thou hast no more brain than have in mine elbows  an assinego may tutor thee  thou scurvy valiant ass  thou art here but to thrash trojans  and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit  like a

troilus  do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse  or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason  nor fear of bad success in a bad cause  can qualify the same  why  brother hector  we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it  nor once deject the courage of our minds  because cassandra s mad  her brain sick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious  for my private part  am no more touch d than all priam s sons  and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain  else might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels  but attest the gods  your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fears attending on so dire a project  for what  alas  can these my single arms  what propugnation is in one man s valour  to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite  yet  protest  were alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as have will  paris should ne er retract what he hath done  nor faint in the pursuit  paris  you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights  you have the honey still  but these the gall  so to be valiant is no praise at all  sir  propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it  but would have the soil of her fair rape wiped off  in honourable keeping her  what treason were it to the ransack d queen  disgrace to your great worths and shame to me  now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion  can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms  there s not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended  nor none so noble whose life were ill bestow d or death unfamed where helen is the subject  then  say  well may we fight for her whom  we know well  the world s large spaces cannot parallel  paris and troilus  you have both said well  and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed  but superficially  not much unlike young men  whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy  the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemper d blood than to make up a free determination  twixt right and wrong  for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision  nature craves all dues be render d to their owners  now  what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband  if this law of nature be corrupted through affection  and that great minds  of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills  resist the same  there is a law in each well order d nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory  if helen then be wife to sparta s king  as it is known she is  these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back return d  thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong  but makes it much more heavy  hector s opinion is this in way of truth  yet ne ertheless  my spritely brethren  propend to you in resolution to keep helen still  for  tis a cause that hath no mean dependance upon our joint and several dignities  why  there you touch d the life of our design  were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens  would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence  but  worthy hector  she is a theme of honour and renown  spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds  whose present courage may beat down our foes  and fame in time to come canonize us  for  presume  brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world s revenue  am yours  you valiant offspring of great priamus  have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dun and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits  was advertised their great general slept  whilst emulation in the army crept  this  presume  will wake him  exeunt the grecian camp  before achilles  tent  enter solus how now  thersites  what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury  shall the elephant ajax carry it thus  he beats me  and rail at him  worthy satisfaction  would it were otherwise  that could beat him  whilst he railed at me   sfoot  i ll learn to conjure and raise devils  but i ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations  then there s achilles  a rare enginer  if troy be not taken till these two undermine it  the walls will stand till they fall of themselves  thou great thunder darter of olympus  forget that thou art jove  the king of gods and  mercury  lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus  if ye take not that little  little less than little wit from them that they have  which short armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce  it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider  without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web  after this  the vengeance on the whole camp  or rather  the bone ache  for that  methinks  is the curse dependent on those that war for a placket  have said my prayers and devil envy say amen  what ho  my lord achilles  enter who s there  thersites  good thersites  come in and rail  if could have remembered a gilt counterfeit  thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation  but it is no matter  thyself upon thyself  the common curse of mankind  folly and ignorance  be thine in great revenue  heaven bless thee from a tutor  and discipline come not near thee  let thy blood be thy direction till thy death  then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse  i ll be sworn and sworn upon t she never

achilles is my lord  am patroclus  knower  and patroclus is a fool  you rascal  peace  fool  have not done  he is a privileged man  proceed  thersites  agamemnon is a fool  achilles is a fool  thersites is a fool  and  as aforesaid  patroclus is a fool  derive this  come  agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles  achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon  thersites is a fool to serve such a fool  and patroclus is a fool positive  why am a fool  make that demand of the prover  it suffices me thou art  look you  who comes here  patroclus  i ll speak with nobody  come in with me  thersites  exit here is such patchery  such juggling and such knavery  all the argument is a cuckold and a whore  a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon  now  the dry serpigo on the subject  and war and lechery confound all  exit enter and where is achilles  within his tent  but ill disposed  my lord  let it be known to him that we are here  he shent our messengers  and we lay by our appertainments  visiting of him  let him be told so  lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place  or know not what we are  shall say so to him  exit we saw him at the opening of his tent  he is not sick  yes  lion sick  sick of proud heart  you may call it melancholy  if you will favour the man  but  by my head   tis pride  but why  why  let him show us the cause  word  my lord  takes aside what moves ajax thus to bay at him  achilles hath inveigled his fool from him  who  thersites  he  then will ajax lack matter  if he have lost his argument  no  you see  he is his argument that has his argument  achilles  all the better  their fraction is more our wish than their faction  but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite  the amity that wisdom knits not  folly may easily untie  here comes patroclus  re enter no achilles with him  the elephant hath joints  but none for courtesy  his legs are legs for necessity  not for flexure  achilles bids me say  he is much sorry  if any thing more than your sport and pleasure did move your greatness and this noble state to call upon him  he hopes it is no other but for your health and your digestion sake  and after dinner s breath  hear you  patroclus  we are too well acquainted with these answers  but his evasion  wing d thus swift with scorn  cannot outfly our apprehensions  much attribute he hath  and much the reason why we ascribe it to him  yet all his virtues  not virtuously on his own part beheld  do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss  yea  like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish  are like to rot untasted  go and tell him  we come to speak with him  and you shall not sin  if you do say we think him over proud and under honest  in self assumption greater than in the note of judgment  and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on  disguise the holy strength of their command  and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance  yea  watch his pettish lunes  his ebbs  his flows  as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide  go tell him this  and add  that if he overhold his price so much  we ll none of him  but let him  like an engine not portable  lie under this report   bring action hither  this cannot go to war  stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant   tell him so  shall  and bring his answer presently  exit in second voice we ll not be satisfied  we come to speak with him  ulysses  enter you  exit what is he more than another  no more than what he thinks he is  is he so much  do you not think he thinks himself a better man than am  no question  will you subscribe his thought  and say he is  no  noble ajax  you are as strong  as valiant  as wise  no less noble  much more gentle  and altogether more tractable  why should a man be proud  how doth pride grow  know not what pride is  your mind is the clearer  ajax  and your virtues the fairer  he that is proud eats up himself  pride is his own glass  his own trumpet  his own chronicle  and whatever praises itself but in the deed  devours the deed in the praise  do hate a proud man  as hate the engendering of toads  yet he loves himself  is t not strange  aside re enter achilles will not to the field to morrow  what s his excuse  he doth rely on none  but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any  in will peculiar and in self admission  why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share the air with us  things small as nothing  for request s sake only  he makes important  possess d he is with greatness  and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at self breath  imagined worth holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse that  twixt his mental and his active parts kingdom d achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself  what should say  he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it cry  no recovery   let ajax go to him  dear lord  go you and greet him in his tent   tis said he holds you well  and will be led at your request a little from himself  agamemnon  let it not be so  we ll consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles  shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts  save such as do revolve and ruminate himself  shall he be worshipp d of that we hold an idol more than he  no  this thrice worthy and right valiant lord must not so stale his palm  nobly acquired  nor  by my will  assubjugate his merit  as amply titled as achilles is  by going to achilles  that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion  this lord go to him  jupiter forbid  and say in thunder  achilles go to him   aside to this is well  he rubs the vein of him  aside to and how his silence drinks up this applause  if go to him  with my armed fist i ll pash him o er the face  no  you shall not go  an a  be proud with me  i ll pheeze his pride  let me go to him  not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel  paltry  insolent fellow  how he

through warm  force him with praises  pour in  pour in  his ambition is dry  to my lord  you feed too much on this dislike  our noble general  do not do so  you must prepare to fight without achilles  why   tis this naming of him does him harm  here is a man  but  tis before his face  will be silent  wherefore should you so  he is not emulous  as achilles is  know the whole world  he is as valiant  whoreson dog  that shall pelter thus with us  would he were a trojan  what a vice were it in ajax now    if he were proud    or covetous of praise    ay  or surly borne    or strange  or self affected

please it our general to pass strangely by him  as if he were forgot  and  princes all  lay negligent and loose regard upon him  will come last   tis like he ll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent on him  if so  have derision medicinable  to use between your strangeness and his pride  which his own will shall have desire to drink  it may be good  pride hath no other glass to show

their smiles before them to achilles  to come as humbly as they used to creep to holy altars  what  am poor of late   tis certain  greatness  once fall n out with fortune  must fall out with men too  what the declined is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall  for men  like butterflies  show not their mealy wings but to the summer  and not a man  for being simply man  hath any honour  but honour for those honours that are without him  as place  riches  favour  prizes of accident as oft as merit  which when they fall  as being slippery standers  the love that lean d on them as slippery too  do one pluck down another and together die in the fall  but  tis not so with me  fortune and are friends  do enjoy at ample point all that did possess  save these men s looks  who do  methinks  find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given  here is ulysses  i ll interrupt his reading  how now ulysses  now  great thetis  son  what are you reading  strange fellow here writes me   that man  how dearly ever parted  how much in having  or without or in  cannot make boast to have that which he hath  nor feels not what he owes  but by reflection  as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver   this is not strange  ulysses  the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not  but commends itself to others  eyes  nor doth the eye itself  that most pure spirit of sense  behold itself  not going from itself  but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each other s form  for speculation turns not to itself  till it hath travell d and is mirror d there where it may see itself  this is not strange at all  do not strain at the position    it is familiar   but at the author s drift  who  in his circumstance  expressly proves that no man is the lord of any thing  though in and of him there be much consisting  till he communicate his parts to others  nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them form d in the applause where they re extended  who  like an arch  reverberates the voice again  or  like a gate of steel fronting the sun  receives and renders back his figure and his heat  was much wrapt in this  and apprehended here immediately the unknown ajax  heavens  what a man is there  a very horse  that has he knows not what  nature  what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use  what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth  now shall we see to morrow   an act that very chance doth throw upon him   ajax renown d  heavens  what some men do  while some men leave to do  how some men creep in skittish fortune s hall  whiles others play the idiots in her eyes  how one man eats into another s pride  while pride is fasting in his wantonness  to see these grecian lords   why  even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder  as if his foot were on brave hector s breast and great troy shrieking  do believe it  for they pass d by me as misers do by beggars  neither gave to me good word nor look  what  are my deeds forgot  time hath  my lord  a wallet at his back  wherein he puts alms for oblivion  great sized monster of ingratitudes  those scraps are good deeds past  which are devour d as fast as they are made  forgot as soon as done  perseverance  dear my lord  keeps honour bright  to have done is to hang quite out of fashion  like a rusty mail in monumental mockery  take the instant way  for honour travels in a strait so narrow  where one but goes abreast  keep then the path  for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue  if you give way  or hedge aside from the direct forthright  like to an enter d tide  they all rush by and leave you hindmost  or like a gallant horse fall n in first rank  lie there for pavement to the abject rear  o er run and trampled on  then what they do in present  though less than yours in past  must o ertop yours  for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand  and with his arms outstretch d  as he would fly  grasps in the comer  welcome ever smiles  and farewell goes out sighing  let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was  for beauty  wit  high birth  vigour of bone  desert in service  love  friendship  charity  are subjects all to envious and calumniating time  one touch of nature makes the whole world kin  that all with one consent praise new born gawds  though they are made and moulded of things past  and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o er dusted  the present eye praises the present object  then marvel not  thou great and complete man  that all the greeks begin to worship ajax  since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what not stirs  the cry went once on thee  and still it might  and yet it may again  if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent  whose glorious deeds  but in these fields of late  made emulous missions  mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction  of this my privacy have strong reasons  but  gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical   tis known  achilles  that you are in love with one of priam s daughters  ha  known  is that a wonder  the providence that s in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus  gold  finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps  keeps place with thought and almost  like the gods  does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles  there is a mystery  with whom relation durst never meddle  in the soul of state  which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to  all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours  my lord  and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena  but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home  when fame shall in our islands sound her trump  and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing   great hector s sister did achilles win  but our great ajax bravely beat down him   farewell  my lord  as your lover speak  the fool slides o er the ice that you should break  exit to this effect  achilles  have moved you  woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathed than an effeminate man in time of action  stand condemn d for this  they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus  sweet  rouse yourself  and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold  and  like a dew drop from the lion s mane  be shook to air  shall ajax fight with hector  ay  and perhaps receive much honour by him  see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gored  then  beware  those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves  omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger  and danger  like an ague  subtly taints even then when we sit idly in the sun  go call thersites hither  sweet patroclus  i ll send the fool to ajax and desire him to invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarm d  have a woman s longing  an appetite that am sick withal  to see great hector in his weeds of peace  to talk with him and to behold his visage  even to my full of view  enter labour saved  wonder  what  ajax goes up and down the field  asking for himself  how so  he must fight singly to morrow with hector  and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing  how can that be  why  he stalks up and down like a peacock   a stride and a stand  ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning  bites his lip with a politic regard  as who should say  there were wit in this head  an  twould out   and so there is  but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint  which will not show without knocking  the man s undone forever  for if hector break not his neck i  the combat  he ll break  t himself in vain glory  he knows not me  said  good morrow  ajax   and he replies  thanks  agamemnon   what think you of this man that takes me for the general  he s grown a very land fish  language less  a monster  plague of opinion  a man may wear it on both sides  like a leather jerkin  thou must be my ambassador to him  thersites  who  why  he ll answer nobody  he professes not answering  speaking is for beggars  he wears his tongue in s arms  will put on his presence  let patroclus make demands to me  you shall see the pageant of ajax  to him  patroclus  tell him humbly desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmed to my tent  and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six or seven times honoured captain general of the grecian army  agamemnon  et cetera  do this

hand both open and both free  for what he has he gives  what thinks he shows  yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty  nor dignifies an impure thought with breath  manly as hector  but more dangerous  for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects  but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love  they call him troilus  and on him erect second hope  as fairly built as hector  thus says aeneas  one that knows the youth even to his inches  and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me  alarum  hector and ajax fight they are in action  now
