delightful engine of her thoughts that blabb d them with such pleasing eloquence  is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage  where  like a sweet melodious bird  it sung sweet varied notes  enchanting every ear  say thou for her  who hath done this deed  thus found her  straying in the park  seeking to hide herself  as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound  it was my deer  and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead  for now stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea  who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave  expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him  this way to death my wretched sons are gone  here stands my other son  a banished man  and here my brother  weeping at my woes  but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn  is dear lavinia  dearer than my soul  had but seen thy picture in this plight  it would have madded me  what shall do now behold thy lively body so  thou hast

look on her  when did name her brothers  then fresh tears stood on her cheeks  as doth the honey dew upon a gather d lily almost wither d  perchance she weeps because they kill d her husband

their sister makes  gentle lavinia  let me kiss thy lips  or make some sign how may do thee ease  shall thy good uncle  and thy brother lucius  and thou  and sit round about some fountain  looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stain d  as meadows  yet not dry  with miry slime left on them by a flood  and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness  and made a brine pit with our bitter tears  or shall we cut away our hands  like thine  or shall we bite our tongues  and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days  what shall we do  let us  that have our tongues  plot some deuce of further misery  to make us wonder d at in time to come  sweet father  cease your tears  for  at your grief  see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps  patience  dear niece  good titus  dry thine eyes  ah  marcus  marcus  brother  well wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine  for thou  poor man  hast drown d it with thine own  ah  my lavinia  will wipe thy cheeks  mark  marcus  mark  understand her signs  had she a tongue to speak  now would she say that to her brother which said to thee  his napkin  with his true tears all bewet  can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks  what a sympathy of woe is this  as far from help as limbo is from bliss  enter titus andronicus  my lord the emperor sends thee this word   that  if thou love thy sons  let marcus  lucius  or thyself  old titus  or any one of you  chop off your hand  and send it to the king  he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive  and that shall be the ransom for their fault  gracious emperor  gentle aaron  did ever raven sing so like a lark  that gives sweet tidings of the sun s uprise  with all my heart  i ll send the emperor my hand  good aaron  wilt thou help to chop it off  stay  father  for that noble hand of thine  that hath thrown down so many enemies  shall not be sent  my hand will serve the turn  my youth can better spare my blood than you  and therefore mine shall save my brothers  lives  which of your hands hath not defended rome  and rear d aloft the bloody battle axe  writing destruction on the enemy s castle  none of

they die before their pardon come  my hand shall go  by heaven  it shall not go  sirs  strive no more  such wither d herbs as these are meet for plucking up  and therefore mine  sweet father  if shall be thought thy son  let me redeem my brothers both from death  and  for our father s sake and mother s care  now let me show a brother s love to thee  agree between you  will spare my hand  then i ll go fetch an axe  but will use the axe  exeunt and come hither  aaron  i ll deceive them both  lend me thy hand  and will give thee mine  aside if that be call d deceit  will be honest  and never

jewels purchased at an easy price  and yet dear too  because bought mine own  go  andronicus  and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee  aside their heads  mean  how this villany doth fat me with the very thoughts of it  let fools do good  and fair men call for grace  aaron will have his soul black like his face  exit here lift this one hand up to heaven  and bow this feeble ruin to the earth  if any power pities wretched tears  to that call  to what  wilt thou kneel with me  do  then  dear heart  for heaven shall hear our prayers  or with our sighs we ll breathe the welkin dim  and stain the sun with fog  as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms  brother  speak with possibilities  and do not break into these deep extremes  is not my sorrow deep  having no bottom  then be my passions bottomless with them  but yet let reason govern thy lament  if there were reason for these miseries  then into limits could bind my woes  when heaven doth weep

blow  she is the weeping welkin  the earth  then must my sea be moved with her sighs  then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge  overflow d and drown d  for why my bowels cannot hide her woes  but like a drunkard must vomit them  then give me leave  for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues  enter a messenger  with two heads and a hand messenger

more than may be borne  to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal  but sorrow flouted at is double death  ah  that this sight should make so deep a wound  and yet detested life not shrink

into the balcony you sad faced men  people and sons of rome  by uproar sever d  like a flight of fowl scatter d by winds and high tempestuous gusts  let me teach you how to knit again this scatter d corn into one mutual sheaf  these broken limbs again into one body  lest rome herself be bane unto herself  and she whom mighty kingdoms court sy to  like a forlorn and desperate castaway  do shameful execution on herself  but if my frosty signs and chaps of age  grave witnesses of true experience  cannot induce you to attend my words  to speak  rome s dear friend  as erst our ancestor  when with his solemn tongue he did discourse to love sick dido s sad attending ear the story of that baleful burning night when subtle greeks surprised king priam s troy  tell us what sinon hath bewitch d our ears  or who hath brought the fatal engine in that gives our troy  our rome  the civil wound  my heart is not compact of flint nor steel  nor can utter all our bitter grief  but floods of tears will drown my oratory  and break my utterance  even in the time when it should move you to attend me most  lending your kind commiseration  here is a captain  let him tell the tale  your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak  then  noble auditory  be it known to you  that cursed chiron and demetrius were they that murdered our emperor s brother  and they it were that ravished our sister  for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded  our father s tears despised  and basely cozen d of that true hand that fought rome s quarrel out  and sent her enemies unto the grave  lastly  myself unkindly banished  the gates shut on me  and turn d weeping out  to beg relief among rome s enemies  who drown d their enmity in my true tears  and oped their arms to embrace me as a friend  am the turned forth  be it known to you  that have preserved her welfare in my blood  and from her bosom took the enemy s point  sheathing the steel in my adventurous body  alas  you know am no vaunter  my scars can witness  dumb although they are  that my report is just and full of truth  but  soft  methinks do digress too much  citing my worthless praise  pardon me  for when no friends are by  men praise themselves  now is my turn to speak  behold this child  pointing to the child in the arms of an attendant of this was tamora delivered  the issue of an irreligious moor  chief architect and plotter of these woes  the villain is alive in titus  house  and as he is  to witness this is true  now judge what cause had titus to revenge these wrongs  unspeakable  past patience  or more than any living man could bear  now you have heard the truth  what say you  romans  have we done aught amiss   show us wherein  and  from the place where you behold us now  the poor remainder of andronici will  hand in hand  all headlong cast us down  and on the ragged stones beat forth our brains  and make a mutual closure of our house  speak  romans  speak  and if you say we shall  lo  hand in hand  lucius and will fall  come  come  thou reverend man of rome  and bring our emperor gently in thy hand  lucius our emperor  for well know the common voice do cry it shall be so  all lucius  all hail  rome s royal emperor  go  go into old titus  sorrowful house  to attendants and hither hale that misbelieving moor  to be adjudged some direful slaughtering death  as punishment for his most wicked life  exeunt attendants and the others descend all lucius  all hail  rome s gracious governor  thanks  gentle romans  may govern so  to heal rome s harms  and wipe away her woe  but  gentle people  give me aim awhile  for nature puts me to a heavy task  stand all aloof  but  uncle  draw you near  to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk  take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips  kissing these sorrowful drops upon thy blood stain d face  the last true duties of thy noble son  tear for tear  and loving kiss for kiss  thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips  were the sum of these that should pay countless and infinite  yet would pay them  come hither  boy  come  come  and learn of us to melt in showers  thy grandsire loved thee well  many a time he danced thee on his knee  sung thee asleep  his loving breast thy pillow  many a matter hath he told to thee  meet and agreeing with thine infancy  in that respect  then  like a loving child  shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring  because kind nature doth require it so  friends should associate friends in grief and woe  bid him farewell  commit him to the grave  do him that kindness  and take leave of him  young grandsire  grandsire  even with all my heart would were dead  so you did live again  lord  cannot speak to him for weeping  my tears will choke me  if ope my mouth  re enter attendants with you sad andronici  have done with woes  give sentence on this execrable wretch  that hath been breeder of these dire events  set him breast deep in earth  and famish him  there let him stand  and rave  and cry for food  if any one relieves or pities him  for the offence he dies  this is our doom  some stay to see him fasten d in the earth  why should wrath be mute  and fury dumb  am no baby  that with base prayers should repent the evils have done  ten thousand worse than ever yet did would perform  if might have my will  if one good deed in all my life did  do repent it from my very soul  some loving friends convey the emperor hence  and give him burial in his father s grave  my father and lavinia shall forthwith be closed in our household s monument  as for that heinous tiger  tamora  no funeral rite  nor man m mourning weeds  no mournful bell shall ring her burial  but throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey  her life was beast like  and devoid of pity  and  being so  shall have like want of pity  see justice done on aaron  that damn d moor  by whom our heavy haps had their beginning  then  afterwards  to order well the state  that like events may ne er it ruinate
