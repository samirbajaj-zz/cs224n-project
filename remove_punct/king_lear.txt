king  would not from your love make such a stray  to match you where hate  therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers  this is most strange  that she  that even but now was your best object  the argument of your praise  balm of your age  most best  most dearest  should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous  to dismantle so many folds of favour  sure  her offence must be of such unnatural degree  that monsters it  or your fore vouch d affection fall n into taint  which to believe of her  must

grossly   tis the infirmity of his age  yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself  the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash  then must we look to receive from his age  not alone the imperfections of long engraffed condition  but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them  such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent s banishment  there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him  pray you  let s hit together  if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears  this last surrender of
