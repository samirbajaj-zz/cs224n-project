censure thus on lovely gentlemen  why not on proteus  as of all the rest  then thus  of many good think him best  your reason  have no other  but a woman s reason  think him so because think him so  and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him  ay  if you thought your love not cast away  why he  of all the rest  hath never moved me  yet he  of all the rest  think  best loves ye  his little

impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice  which with an hour s heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form  little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot  enter how now  sir proteus  is your countryman according to our proclamation gone  gone  my good lord  my daughter takes his going grievously  little time  my lord  will kill that grief  so believe  but thurio thinks not so  proteus  the good conceit hold of thee   for thou hast shown some sign of good desert   makes me the better to confer with thee  longer than prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace  thou know st how willingly would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter  do  my lord  and also  think  thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will she did  my lord  when valentine was here  ay  and perversely she persevers so  what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio  the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood  cowardice and poor descent  three things that women highly hold in hate  ay  but she ll think that it is spoke in hate  ay  if his enemy deliver it  therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend  then you must undertake to slander him  and that  my lord  shall be loath to do   tis an ill office for a gentleman  especially against his very friend  where your good word cannot advantage him  your slander never can endamage him  therefore the office is indifferent  being entreated to it by your friend  you have prevail d  my lord  if can do it by ought that can speak in his dispraise  she shall not long continue love to him  but say this weed her love from valentine  it follows not that she will love sir thurio  therefore  as you unwind her love from him  lest it should ravel and be good to none  you must provide to bottom it on me  which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine  and  proteus  we dare trust you in this kind  because we know  on valentine s report  you are already love s firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind  upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large  for she is lumpish  heavy  melancholy  and  for your friend s sake  will be glad of you  where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend  as much as can do  will effect  but you  sir thurio  are not sharp enough  you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets  whose composed rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows  ay  much is the force of heaven bred poesy  say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears  your sighs  your heart  write till your ink be dry  and with your tears moist it again  and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity  for orpheus  lute was strung with poets  sinews  whose golden touch could soften steel and stones  make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands  after your dire lamenting elegies  visit by night your lady s chamber window with some sweet concert  to their instruments tune a deploring dump  the night s dead silence will well become such sweet complaining grievance  this  or else nothing  will inherit her  this discipline shows thou hast been in love  and thy advice this
