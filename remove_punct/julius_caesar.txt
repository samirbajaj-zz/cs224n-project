shoes  to get myself into more work  but  indeed  sir  we make holiday  to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph  wherefore rejoice  what conquest brings he home  what tributaries follow him to rome  to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels  you blocks  you stones  you worse than senseless things  you hard hearts  you cruel men of rome  knew you not pompey  many a time and oft have you climb d up to walls and battlements  to towers and windows  yea  to chimney tops  your infants in your arms  and there have sat the livelong day  with patient expectation  to see great pompey pass the streets of rome  and when you saw his chariot but appear  have you not made an universal shout  that tiber trembled underneath her banks  to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores  and do you now put on your best attire  and do you now cull out a holiday  and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompey s blood  be gone  run to your houses  fall upon your knees  pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude  go  go  good countrymen  and  for this fault  assemble all the poor men of your sort  draw them to tiber banks  and weep your tears into the channel  till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all  exeunt all the commoners see whether their basest metal be not moved  they vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness  go you down that way towards the capitol  this way will disrobe the images  if you do find them deck d with ceremonies  may we do so  you know it is the feast of lupercal  it is no matter  let no images be hung with caesar s trophies  i ll about  and drive away the vulgar from the streets  so do you too  where you perceive them thick  these growing feathers pluck d from caesar s wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch  who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness  exeunt public place  flourish  enter for the course  and a great crowd following  among them a soothsayer calpurnia  peace  ho  caesar speaks  calpurnia  here  my lord  stand you directly in antonius  way  when he doth run his course  antonius  caesar  my lord  forget not  in your speed  antonius  to touch calpurnia  for our elders say  the barren  touched in this holy chase  shake off their sterile curse  shall remember  when caesar says  do this   it is perform d  set on  and leave no ceremony out  flourish soothsayer caesar  ha  who calls  bid every noise be still  peace yet again  who is it in the press that calls on me  hear a tongue  shriller than all the music  cry  caesar   speak  caesar is turn d to hear  soothsayer beware the ides of march  what man is that  soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march  set him before me  let me see his face  fellow  come from the throng  look upon caesar  what say st thou to me now  speak once again  soothsayer beware the ides of march  he is a dreamer  let us leave him  pass  sennet  exeunt all except and will you go see the order of the course  not pray you  do  am not gamesome  do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony  let me not hinder  cassius  your desires  i ll leave you  brutus  do observe you now of late  have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as was wont to have  you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you  cassius  be not deceived  if have veil d my look  turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself  vexed am of late with passions of some difference  conceptions only proper to myself  which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors  but let not therefore my good friends be grieved   among which number  cassius  be you one   nor construe any further my neglect  than that poor brutus  with himself at war  forgets the shows of love to other men  then  brutus  have much mistook your passion  by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value  worthy cogitations  tell me  good brutus  can you see your face  no  cassius  for the eye sees not itself  but by reflection  by some other things   tis just  and it is very much lamented  brutus  that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye  that you might see your shadow  have heard  where many of the best respect in rome  except immortal caesar  speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age s yoke  have wish d that noble brutus had his eyes  into what dangers would you lead me  cassius  that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me  therefore  good brutus  be prepared to hear  and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection  your glass  will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of  and be not jealous on me  gentle brutus  were a common laugher  or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester  if you know that do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them  or if you know that profess myself in banqueting to all the rout  then hold me dangerous  flourish  and shout what means this shouting  do fear  the people choose caesar for their king  ay  do you fear it  then must think you would not have it so  would not  cassius  yet love him well  but wherefore do you hold me here so long  what is it that you would impart to me  if it be aught toward the general good  set honour in one eye and death i  the other  and will look on both indifferently  for let the gods so speed me as love the name of honour more than fear death  know that virtue to be in you  brutus  as well as do know your outward favour  well  honour is the subject of my story  cannot tell what you and other men think of this life  but  for my single self  had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as myself  was born free as caesar  so were you  we both have fed as well  and we can both endure the winter s cold as well as he  for once  upon a raw and gusty day  the troubled tiber chafing with her shores  caesar said to me  darest thou  cassius  now leap in with me into this angry flood  and swim to yonder point   upon the word  accoutred as was  plunged in and bade him follow  so indeed he did  the torrent roar d  and we did buffet it with lusty sinews  throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy  but ere we could arrive the point proposed  caesar cried  help me  cassius  or sink   as aeneas  our great ancestor  did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear  so from the waves of tiber did the tired caesar  and this man is now become a god  and cassius is wretched creature and must bend his body  if caesar carelessly but nod on him  he had a fever when he was in spain  and when the fit was on him  did mark how he did shake   tis true  this god did shake  his coward lips did from their colour fly  and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre  did hear him groan  ay  and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books  alas  it cried  give me some drink  titinius   as a sick girl  ye gods  it doth amaze me man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone  shout  flourish another general shout  do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heap d on caesar  why  man  he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus  and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves  men at some time are masters of their fates  the fault  dear brutus  is not in our stars  but in ourselves  that we are underlings  brutus and caesar  what should be in that  caesar   why should that name be sounded more than yours  write them together  yours is as fair a name  sound them  it doth become the mouth as well  weigh them  it is as heavy  conjure with  em  brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar  now  in the names of all the gods at once  upon what meat doth this our caesar feed  that he is grown so great  age  thou art shamed  rome  thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods  when went there by an age  since the great flood  but it was famed with more than with one man  when could they say till now  that talk d of rome  that her wide walls encompass d but one man  now is it rome indeed and room enough  when there is in it but one only man  you and have heard our fathers say  there was a brutus once that would have brook d the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king  that you do love me  am nothing jealous  what you would work me to  have some aim  how have thought of this and of these times  shall recount hereafter  for this present  would not  so with love might entreat you  be any further moved  what you have said will consider  what you have to say will with patience hear  and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things  till then  my noble friend  chew upon this  brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us  am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus  the games are done and caesar is returning  as they pass by  pluck casca by the sleeve  and he will  after his sour fashion  tell you what hath proceeded worthy note to day  re enter and his train will do so  but  look you  cassius  the angry spot doth glow on caesar s brow  and all the rest look like a chidden train  calpurnia s cheek is pale  and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol  being cross d in conference by some senators  casca will tell us what the matter is  antonius  caesar  let me have men about me that are fat  sleek headed men and such as sleep o  nights  yond cassius has a lean and hungry look  he thinks too much  such men are dangerous  fear him not  caesar  he s not dangerous  he is a noble roman and well given  would he were fatter  but fear him not  yet if my name were liable to fear  do not know the man should avoid so soon as that spare cassius  he reads much  he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men  he loves no plays  as thou dost  antony  he hears no music  seldom he smiles  and smiles in such a sort as if he mock d himself and scorn d his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing  such men as he be never at heart s ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves  and therefore are they very dangerous  rather tell thee what is to be fear d than what fear  for always am caesar  come on my right hand  for this ear is deaf  and tell me truly what thou think st of him  sennet  exeunt and all his train  but you pull d me by the cloak  would you speak with me  ay  casca  tell us what hath chanced to day  that caesar looks so sad  why  you were with him  were you not  should not then ask casca what had chanced  why  there was a crown offered him  and being offered him  he put it by with the back of his hand  thus  and then the people fell a shouting  what was the second noise for  why  for that too  they shouted thrice  what was the last cry for  why  for that too  was the crown offered him thrice  ay  marry  was t  and he put it by thrice  every time gentler than other  and at every putting by mine honest neighbours shouted  who offered him the crown  why  antony  tell us the manner of it  gentle casca  can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it  it was mere foolery  did not mark it  saw mark antony offer him a crown   yet  twas not a crown neither   twas one of these coronets   and  as told you  he put it by once  but  for all that  to my thinking  he would fain have had it  then he offered it to him again  then he put it by again  but  to my thinking  he was very loath to lay his fingers off it  and then he offered it the third time  he put it the third time by  and still as he refused it  the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar  for he swounded and fell down at it  and for mine own part  durst not laugh  for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air  but  soft  pray you  what  did caesar swound  he fell down in the market place  and foamed at mouth  and was speechless   tis very like  he hath the failing sickness  no  caesar hath it not  but you and and honest casca  we have the falling sickness  know not what you mean by that  but  am sure  caesar fell down  if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him  according as he pleased and displeased them  as they use to do the players in the theatre  am no true man  what said he when he came unto himself  marry  before he fell down  when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown  he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut  an had been a man of any occupation  if would not have taken him at a word  would might go to hell among the rogues  and so he fell  when he came to himself again  he said  if he had done or said any thing amiss  he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity  three or four wenches  where stood  cried  alas  good soul   and forgave him with all their hearts  but there s no heed to be taken of them  if caesar had stabbed their mothers  they would have done no less  and after that  he came  thus sad  away  ay  did cicero say any thing  ay  he spoke greek  to what effect  nay  an tell you that  ill ne er look you i  the face again  but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads  but  for mine own part  it was greek to me  could tell you more news too  marullus and flavius  for pulling scarfs off caesar s images  are put to silence  fare you well  there was more foolery yet  if could remember it  will you sup with me to night  casca  no  am promised forth  will you dine with me to morrow  ay  if be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating  good  will expect you  do so  farewell  both  exit what a blunt fellow is this grown to be  he was quick mettle when he went to school  so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise  however he puts on this tardy form  this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit  which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite  and so it is  for this time will leave you  to morrow  if you please to speak with me  will come home to you  or  if you will  come home to me  and will wait for you  will do so  till then  think of the world  exit well  brutus  thou art noble  yet  see  thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed  therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes  for who so firm that cannot be seduced  caesar doth bear me hard  but he loves brutus  if were brutus now and he were cassius  he should not humour me  will this night  in several hands  in at his windows throw  as if they came from several citizens  writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name  wherein obscurely caesar s ambition shall be glanced at  and after this let caesar seat him sure  for we will shake him  or worse days endure  exit the same  street  thunder and lightning  enter from opposite sides  with his sword drawn  and good even  casca  brought you caesar home  why are you breathless  and why stare you so  are not you moved  when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm  cicero  have seen tempests  when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks  and have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam  to be exalted with the threatening clouds  but never till to night  never till now  did go through a tempest dropping fire  either there is a civil strife in heaven  or else the world  too saucy with the gods  incenses them to send destruction  why  saw you any thing more wonderful  common slave  you know him well by sight   held up his left hand  which did flame and burn like twenty torches join d  and yet his hand  not sensible of fire  remain d unscorch d  besides  i ha  not since put up my sword   against the capitol met a lion  who glared upon me  and went surly by  without annoying me  and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women  transformed with their fear  who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets  and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon day upon the market place  hooting and shrieking  when these prodigies do so conjointly meet  let not men say  these are their reasons  they are natural   for  believe  they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon  indeed  it is a strange disposed time  but men may construe things after their fashion  clean from the purpose of the things themselves  come caesar to the capitol to morrow  he doth  for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there to morrow  good night then  casca  this disturbed sky is not to walk in  farewell  cicero  exit enter who s there  roman  casca  by your voice  your ear is good  cassius  what night is this  very pleasing night to honest men  who ever knew the heavens menace so  those that have known the earth so full of faults  for my part  have walk d about the streets  submitting me unto the perilous night  and  thus unbraced  casca  as you see  have bared my bosom to the thunder stone  and when the cross blue lightning seem d to open the breast of heaven  did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it  but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens  it is the part of men to fear and tremble  when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us  you are dull  casca  and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want  or else you use not  you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder  to see the strange impatience of the heavens  but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires  why all these gliding ghosts  why birds and beasts from quality and kind  why old men fool and children calculate  why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous quality   why  you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits  to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state  now could casca  name to thee a man most like this dreadful night  that thunders  lightens  opens graves  and roars as doth the lion in the capitol  man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action  yet prodigious grown and fearful  as these strange eruptions are   tis caesar that you mean  is it not  cassius  let it be who it is  for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors  but  woe the while  our fathers  minds are dead  and we are govern d with our mothers  spirits  our yoke and sufferance show us womanish  indeed  they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king  and he shall wear his crown by sea and land  in every place  save here in italy  know where will wear this dagger then  cassius from bondage will deliver cassius  therein  ye gods  you make the weak most strong  therein  ye gods  you tyrants do defeat  nor stony tower  nor walls of beaten brass  nor airless dungeon  nor strong links of iron  can be retentive to the strength of spirit  but life  being weary of these worldly bars  never lacks power to dismiss itself  if know this  know all the world besides  that part of tyranny that do bear can shake off at pleasure  thunder still so can i  so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity  and why should caesar be a tyrant then  poor man  know he would not be a wolf  but that he sees the romans are but sheep  he were no lion  were not romans hinds  those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws  what trash is rome  what rubbish and what offal  when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar  but  grief  where hast thou led me  perhaps speak this before a willing bondman  then know my answer must be made  but am arm d  and dangers are to me indifferent  you speak to casca  and to such a man that is no fleering tell tale  hold  my hand  be factious for redress of all these griefs  and will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest  there s a bargain made  now know you  casca  have moved already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourable dangerous consequence  and do know  by this  they stay for me in pompey s porch  for now  this fearful night  there is no stir or walking in the streets  and the complexion of the element in favour s like the work we have in hand  most bloody  fiery  and most terrible  stand close awhile  for here comes one in haste   tis cinna  do know him by his gait  he is a friend  enter cinna  where haste you so  to find out you  who s that  metellus cimber  no  it is casca  one incorporate to our attempts  am not stay d for  cinna  am glad on  t  what a fearful night is this  there s two or three of us have seen strange sights  am not stay d for  tell me  yes  you are  cassius  if you could but win the noble brutus to our party   be you content  good cinna  take this paper  and look you lay it in the praetor s chair  where brutus may but find it  and throw this in at his window  set this up with wax upon old brutus  statue  all this done  repair to pompey s porch  where you shall find us  is decius brutus and trebonius there  all but metellus cimber  and he s gone to seek you at your house  well  will hie  and so bestow these papers as you bade me  that done  repair to pompey s theatre  exit come  casca  you and will yet ere day see brutus at his house  three parts of him is ours already  and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours  he sits high in all the people s hearts  and that which would appear offence in us  his countenance  like richest alchemy  will change to virtue and to worthiness  him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited  let us go  for it is after midnight  and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him  exeunt rome  brutus s orchard  enter what  lucius  ho  cannot  by the progress of the stars  give guess how near to day  lucius  say  would it were my fault to sleep so soundly  when  lucius  when  awake  say  what  lucius  enter call d you  my lord  get me a taper in my study  lucius  when it is lighted  come and call me here  will  my lord  exit it must be by his death  and for my part  know no personal cause to spurn at him  but for the general  he would be crown d  how that might change his nature  there s the question  it is the bright day that brings forth the adder  and that craves wary walking  crown him   that    and then  grant  we put a sting in him  that at his will he may do danger with  the abuse of greatness is  when it disjoins remorse from power  and  to speak truth of caesar  have not known when his affections sway d more than his reason  but  tis a common proof  that lowliness is young ambition s ladder  whereto the climber upward turns his face  but when he once attains the upmost round  he then unto the ladder turns his back  looks in the clouds  scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend  so caesar may  then  lest he may  prevent  and  since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is  fashion it thus  that what he is  augmented  would run to these and these extremities  and therefore think him as a serpent s egg which  hatch d  would  as his kind  grow mischievous  and kill him in the shell  re enter the taper burneth in your

knocking within  tis good  go to the gate  somebody knocks  exit since cassius first did whet me against caesar  have not slept  between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion  all the interim is like a phantasma  or a hideous dream  the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council  and the state of man  like to a little kingdom  suffers then the nature of an insurrection  re enter sir   tis your brother cassius at the door  who doth desire to see you  is he alone  no  sir  there are moe with him  do you know them  no  sir  their hats are pluck d about their ears  and half their faces buried in their cloaks  that by no means may discover them by any mark of favour  let  em enter  exit they are the faction  conspiracy  shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night  when evils are most free  then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage  seek none  conspiracy  hide it in smiles and affability  for if thou path  thy native semblance on  not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention  enter the conspirators  and think we are too bold upon your rest  good morrow  brutus  do we trouble you  have been up this hour  awake all night  know these men that come along with you  yes  every man of them  and no man here but honours you  and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you  this is trebonius  he is welcome hither  this  decius brutus  he is welcome too  this  casca  this  cinna  and this  metellus cimber  they are all welcome  what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night  shall entreat a word  and whisper here lies the east  doth not the day break here  no  pardon  sir  it doth  and yon gray lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day  you shall confess that you are both deceived  here  as point my sword  the sun arises  which is a great way growing on the south  weighing the youthful season of the year  some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire  and the high east stands  as the capitol  directly here  give me your hands all over  one by one  and let us swear our resolution  no  not an oath  if not the face of men  the sufferance of our souls  the time s abuse    if these be motives weak  break off betimes  and every man hence to his idle bed  so let high sighted tyranny range on  till each man drop by lottery  but if these  as am sure they do  bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women  then  countrymen  what need we any spur but our own cause  to prick us to redress  what other bond than secret romans  that have spoke the word  and will not palter  and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged  that this shall be  or we will fall for it  swear priests and cowards and men cautelous  old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs  unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt  but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise  nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits  to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath  when every drop of blood that every roman bears  and nobly bears  is guilty of a several bastardy  if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass d from him  but what of cicero  shall we sound him  think he will stand very strong with us  let us not leave him out  no  by no means  let us have him  for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men s voices to commend our deeds  it shall be said  his judgment ruled our hands  our youths and wildness shall no whit appear  but all be buried in his gravity  name him not  let us not break with him  for he will never follow any thing that other men begin  then leave him out  indeed he is not fit  shall no man else be touch d but only caesar  decius  well urged  think it is not meet  mark antony  so well beloved of caesar  should outlive caesar  we shall find of him shrewd contriver  and  you know  his means  if he improve them  may well stretch so far as to annoy us all  which to prevent  let antony and caesar fall together  our course will seem too bloody  caius cassius  to cut the head off and then hack the limbs  like wrath in death and envy afterwards  for antony is but a limb of caesar  let us be sacrificers  but not butchers  caius  we all stand up against the spirit of caesar  and in the spirit of men there is no blood  that we then could come by caesar s spirit  and not dismember caesar  but  alas  caesar must bleed for it  and  gentle friends  let s kill him boldly  but not wrathfully  let s carve him as a dish fit for the gods  not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds  and let our hearts  as subtle masters do  stir up their servants to an act of rage  and after seem to chide  em  this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious  which so appearing to the common eyes  we shall be call d purgers  not murderers  and for mark antony  think not of him  for he can do no more than caesar s arm when caesar s head is off  yet fear him  for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar   alas  good cassius  do not think of him  if he love caesar  all that he can do is to himself  take thought and die for caesar  and that were much he should  for he is given to sports  to wildness and much company  there is no fear in him  let him not die  for he will live  and laugh at this hereafter  clock strikes peace  count the clock  the clock hath stricken three   tis time to part  but it is doubtful yet  whether caesar will come forth to day  or no  for he is superstitious grown of late  quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy  of dreams and ceremonies  it may be  these apparent prodigies  the unaccustom d terror of this night  and the persuasion of his augurers  may hold him from the capitol to day  never fear that  if he be so resolved  can o ersway him  for he loves to hear that unicorns

contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness  no  my brutus  you have some sick offence within your mind  which  by the right and virtue of my place  ought to know of  and  upon my knees  charm you  by my once commended beauty  by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one  that you unfold to me  yourself  your half  why

back  when they shall see the face of caesar  they are vanished  caesar  never stood on ceremonies  yet now they fright me  there is one within  besides the things that we have heard and seen  recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch  lioness hath whelped in the streets  and graves have yawn d  and yielded up their dead  fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds  in ranks and squadrons and right form of war  which drizzled blood upon the capitol  the noise of battle hurtled in the air  horses did neigh  and dying men did groan  and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets  caesar  these things are beyond all use  and do fear them  what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods  yet caesar shall go forth  for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar  when beggars die  there are no comets seen  the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes  cowards die many times before their deaths  the valiant never taste of death but once  of all the wonders that yet have heard  it seems to me most strange that men should fear  seeing that death  a necessary end  will come when it will come  re enter servant what say the augurers  servant they would not have you to stir forth to day  plucking the entrails of an offering forth  they could not find a heart within the beast  the gods do this in shame of cowardice  caesar should be a beast without a heart  if he should stay at home to day for fear  no  caesar shall not  danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he  we are two lions litter d in one day  and the elder and more terrible  and caesar shall go forth  alas  my lord  your wisdom is consumed in confidence  do not go forth to day  call it my fear that keeps you in the house  and not your own

cause is in my will  will not come  that is enough to satisfy the senate  but for your private satisfaction  because love you  will let you know  calpurnia here  my wife  stays me at home  she dreamt to night she saw my statua  which  like a fountain with an hundred spouts  did run pure blood  and many lusty romans came smiling  and did bathe their hands in it  and these does she apply for warnings  and portents  and evils imminent  and on her knee hath begg d that will stay at home to day  this dream is all amiss interpreted  it was a vision fair and fortunate  your statue spouting blood in many pipes  in which so many smiling romans bathed  signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood  and that great men shall press for tinctures  stains  relics and cognizance  this by calpurnia s dream is signified  and this way have you well expounded it  have  when you have heard what can say  and know it now  the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar  if you shall send them word you will not come  their minds may change  besides  it were a mock apt to be render d  for some one to say  break up the senate till another time  when caesar s wife shall meet with better dreams   if caesar hide himself  shall they not whisper  lo  caesar is afraid   pardon me  caesar  for my dear dear love to our proceeding bids me tell you this  and reason

mighty  and most puissant caesar  metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart    kneeling must prevent thee  cimber  these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men  and turn pre ordinance and first decree into the law of children  be not fond  to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thaw d from the true quality with that which melteth fools  mean  sweet words  low crooked court sies and base spaniel fawning  thy brother by decree is banished  if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him  spurn thee like a cur out of my way  know  caesar doth not wrong  nor without cause will he be satisfied  is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesar s ear for the repealing of my banish d brother  kiss thy hand  but not in flattery  caesar  desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal  what  brutus  pardon  caesar  caesar  pardon  as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall  to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber  could be well moved  if were as you  if could pray to move  prayers would move me  but am constant as the northern star  of whose true fix d and

friends  that have abridged his time of fearing death  stoop  romans  stoop  and let us bathe our hands in caesar s blood up to the elbows  and besmear our swords  then walk we forth  even to the market place  and  waving our red weapons o er our heads  let s all cry  peace  freedom and liberty   stoop  then  and wash  how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown  how many times shall caesar bleed in sport  that now on pompey s basis lies along no worthier than the dust  so oft as that shall be  so often shall the knot of us be

soft  who comes here  friend of antony s  servant thus  brutus  did my master bid me kneel  thus did mark antony bid me fall down  and  being prostrate  thus he bade me say  brutus is noble  wise  valiant  and honest  caesar was mighty  bold  royal  and loving  say love brutus  and honour him  say fear d caesar  honour d him and loved him  if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him  and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death  mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living  but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith  so says my master antony  thy master is a wise and valiant roman  never thought him worse  tell him  so please him come unto this place  he shall be satisfied  and  by my honour  depart untouch d  servant i ll fetch him presently  exit know that we shall have him well to friend  wish we may  but yet have a mind that fears him much  and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose  but here comes antony  re enter welcome  mark antony  mighty caesar  dost thou lie so low  are all thy conquests  glories  triumphs  spoils  shrunk to this little measure  fare thee well  know not  gentlemen  what you intend  who else must be let blood  who else is rank  if myself  there is no hour so fit as caesar s death hour  nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords  made rich with the most noble blood of all this world  do beseech ye  if you bear me hard  now  whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke  fulfil your pleasure  live a thousand years  shall not find myself so apt to die  no place will please me so  no mean of death  as here by caesar  and by you cut off  the choice and master spirits of this age  antony  beg not your death of us  though now we must appear bloody and cruel  as  by our hands and this our present act  you see we do  yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done  our hearts you see not  they are pitiful  and pity to the general wrong of rome   as fire drives out fire  so pity pity   hath done this deed on caesar  for your part  to you our swords have leaden points  mark antony  our arms  in strength of malice  and our hearts of brothers  temper  do receive you in with all kind love  good thoughts  and reverence  your voice shall be as strong as any man s in the disposing of new dignities  only be patient till we have appeased the multitude  beside themselves with fear  and then we will deliver you the cause  why that did love caesar when struck him  have thus proceeded  doubt not of your wisdom  let each man render me his bloody hand  first  marcus brutus  will shake with you  next  caius cassius  do take your hand  now  decius brutus  yours  now yours  metellus  yours  cinna  and  my valiant casca  yours  though last  not last in love  yours  good trebonius  gentlemen all   alas  what shall say  my credit now stands on such slippery ground  that one of two bad ways you must conceit me  either a coward or a flatterer  that did love thee  caesar   tis true  if then thy spirit look upon us now  shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death  to see thy thy anthony making his peace  shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes  most noble  in the presence of thy corse  had as many eyes as thou hast wounds  weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood  it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies  pardon me  julius  here wast thou bay d  brave hart  here didst thou fall  and here thy hunters stand  sign d in thy spoil  and crimson d in thy lethe  world  thou wast the forest to this hart  and this  indeed  world  the heart of thee  how like a deer  strucken by many princes  dost thou here lie  mark antony    pardon me  caius cassius  the enemies of caesar shall say this  then  in a friend  it is cold modesty  blame you not for praising caesar so  but what compact mean you to have with us  will you be prick d in number of our friends  or shall we on  and not depend on you  therefore took your hands  but was  indeed  sway d from the point  by looking down on caesar  friends am with you all and love you all  upon this hope  that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous  or else were this a savage spectacle  our reasons are so full of good regard that were you  antony  the son of caesar  you should be satisfied  that s all seek  and am moreover suitor that may produce his body to the market place  and in the pulpit  as becomes a friend  speak in the order of his funeral  you shall  mark antony  brutus  a word with you  aside to you know not what you do  do not consent that antony speak in his funeral  know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter  by your pardon  will myself into the pulpit first  and show the reason of our caesar s death  what antony shall speak  will protest he speaks by leave and by permission  and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies  it shall advantage more than do us wrong  know not what may fall  like it not  mark antony  here  take you caesar s body  you shall not in your funeral speech blame us  but speak all good you can devise of caesar  and say you do t by our permission  else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral  and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto am going  after my speech is ended  be it so  do desire no more  prepare the body then  and follow us  exeunt all but pardon me  thou bleeding piece of earth  that am meek and gentle with these butchers  thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times  woe to the hand that shed this costly blood  over thy wounds now do prophesy    which  like dumb mouths  do ope their ruby lips  to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue   curse shall light upon the limbs of men  domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy  blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarter d with the hands of war  all pity choked with custom of fell deeds  and caesar s spirit  ranging for revenge  with ate by his side come hot from hell  shall in these confines with a monarch s voice cry  havoc   and let slip the dogs of war  that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men  groaning for burial  enter a servant you serve octavius caesar  do you not  servant do  mark antony  caesar did write for him to come to rome  servant he did receive his letters  and is coming  and bid me say to you by word of mouth   caesar    seeing the body thy heart is big  get thee apart and weep  passion  see  is catching  for mine eyes  seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine  began to water  is thy master coming  servant he lies to night within seven leagues of rome  post back with speed  and tell him what hath chanced  here is a mourning rome  a dangerous rome  no rome of safety for octavius yet  hie hence  and tell him so  yet  stay awhile  thou shalt not back till have borne this corse into the market

exeunt with caesar s body the forum  enter and and a throng of citizens citizens we will be satisfied  let us be satisfied  then follow me  and give me audience  friends  cassius  go you into the other street  and part the numbers  those that will hear me speak  let  em stay here  those that will follow cassius  go with him  and public reasons shall be rendered of caesar s death  first citizen will hear brutus speak  second citizen will hear cassius  and compare their reasons  when severally we hear them rendered  exit with some of the citizens  goes into the pulpit third citizen the noble brutus is ascended  silence  be patient till the last  romans  countrymen  and lovers  hear me for my cause  and be silent  that you may hear  believe me for mine honour  and have respect to mine honour  that you may believe  censure me in your wisdom  and awake your senses  that you may the better judge  if there be any in this assembly  any dear friend of caesar s  to him say  that brutus  love to caesar was no less than his  if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar  this is my answer    not that loved caesar less  but that loved rome more  had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves  than that caesar were dead  to live all free men  as caesar loved me  weep for him  as he was fortunate  rejoice at it  as he was valiant  honour him  but  as he was ambitious  slew him  there is tears for his love  joy for his fortune  honour for his valour  and death for his ambition  who is here so base that would be a bondman  if any  speak  for him have offended  who is here so rude that would not be a roman  if any  speak  for him have offended  who is here so vile that will not love his country  if any  speak  for him have offended  pause for a reply  all none  brutus  none  then none have offended  have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus  the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol  his glory not extenuated  wherein he was worthy  nor his offences enforced  for which he suffered death  enter and others  with caesar s body here comes his body  mourned by mark antony  who  though he had no hand in his death  shall receive the benefit of his dying  a place in the commonwealth  as which of you shall not  with this depart   that  as slew my best lover for the good of rome  have the same dagger for myself  when it shall please my country to need my death  all live  brutus  live  live  first citizen bring him with triumph home unto his house  second citizen give him a statue with his ancestors  third citizen let

brutus speaks  first citizen peace  ho  good countrymen  let me depart alone  and  for my sake  stay here with antony  do grace to caesar s corpse  and grace his speech tending to caesar s glories  which mark antony  by our permission  is allow d to make  do entreat you  not a man depart  save alone  till antony have spoke  exit first citizen stay  ho  and let us hear mark antony  third citizen let him go up into the public chair  we ll hear him  noble antony  go up  for brutus  sake  am beholding to you  goes into the pulpit fourth citizen what does he say of brutus  third citizen he says  for brutus  sake  he finds himself beholding to us all  fourth citizen  twere best he speak no harm of brutus here  first citizen this caesar was a tyrant  third citizen nay  that s certain  we are blest that rome is rid of him  second citizen peace  let us hear what antony can say  you gentle romans    citizens peace  ho  let us hear him  friends  romans  countrymen  lend me your ears  come to bury caesar  not to praise him  the evil that men do lives after them  the good is oft interred with their bones  so let it be with caesar  the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious  if it were so  it was a grievous fault  and grievously hath caesar answer d it  here  under leave of brutus and the rest   for brutus is an honourable man  so are they all  all honourable men   come to speak in caesar s funeral  he was my friend  faithful and just to me  but brutus says he was ambitious  and brutus is an honourable man  he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill  did this in caesar seem ambitious  when that the poor have cried  caesar hath wept  ambition should be made of sterner stuff  yet brutus says he was ambitious  and brutus is an honourable man  you all did see that on the lupercal thrice presented him a kingly crown  which he did thrice refuse  was this ambition  yet brutus says he was ambitious  and  sure  he is an honourable man  speak not to disprove what brutus spoke  but here am to speak what do know  you all did love him once  not without cause  what cause withholds you then  to mourn for him  judgment  thou art fled to brutish beasts  and men have lost their reason  bear with me  my heart is in the coffin there with caesar  and must pause till it come back to me  first citizen methinks there is much

come  come  the cause  if arguing make us sweat  the proof of it will turn to redder drops  look  draw a sword against conspirators  when think you that the sword goes up again  never  till caesar s three and thirty wounds be well avenged  or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors  caesar  thou canst not die by traitors  hands  unless thou bring st them with thee  so

battle all our liberties  you know that held epicurus strong and his opinion  now change my mind  and partly credit things that do presage  coming from sardis  on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell  and there they perch d  gorging and feeding from our soldiers  hands  who to philippi here consorted us  this morning are they fled away and gone  and in their steads do ravens  crows and kites  fly o er our heads and downward look on us  as we were sickly prey  their shadows seem canopy most fatal  under which our army lies  ready to give up the ghost  believe not so  but believe it partly  for am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly  even so  lucilius  now  most noble brutus  the gods to day stand friendly  that we may  lovers in peace  lead on our days to age  but since the affairs of men rest still incertain  let s reason with the worst that may befall  if we do lose this battle  then is this the very last time we shall speak together  what are you then determined to do  even by the rule of that philosophy by which did blame cato for the death which he did give himself  know not how  but do find it cowardly and vile  for fear of what might fall  so to prevent the time of life  arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below  then  if we lose this battle  you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome  no  cassius  no  think not  thou noble roman  that ever brutus will go bound to rome  he bears too great a mind  but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun  and whether we shall meet again know not  therefore our everlasting farewell take  for ever  and for ever  farewell  cassius  if we do meet again  why  we shall smile  if not  why then  this parting was well made  for ever  and for ever  farewell  brutus  if we do meet again  we ll smile indeed  if not   tis true this parting was well made  why  then  lead on  that a man might know the end of this day s business ere it come  but it sufficeth that the day will end  and then the end is known  come  ho  away  exeunt the same  the field of battle  alarum  enter and ride  ride  messala  ride  and

 all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar  he only  in a general honest thought and common good to all  made one of them  his life was gentle  and the elements so mix d in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world  this was a man   according to his virtue let us use him  with all respect and rites of burial  within my tent his bones to night shall lie  most like a soldier  order d honourably  so call the field to rest  and let s away  to part the glories of this happy day
