of death end woes and all  merchant of syracuse  plead no more  am not partial to infringe our laws  the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants  our well dealing countrymen  who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seal d his rigorous statutes with their bloods  excludes all pity from our threatening looks  for  since the mortal and intestine jars  twixt thy seditious countrymen and us  it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves  to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay  more  if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs  again  if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus  he dies  his goods confiscate to the duke s dispose  unless a thousand marks be levied  to quit the penalty and to ransom him  thy substance  valued at the highest rate  cannot amount unto a hundred marks  therefore by law thou art condemned to die  yet this my comfort  when your words are done  my woes end likewise with the evening sun  well  syracusian  say in brief the cause why thou departed st from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus  heavier task could not have been imposed than to speak my griefs unspeakable  yet  that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature  not by vile offence  i ll utter what my sorrows give me leave  in syracusa was born  and wed unto a woman  happy but for me  and by me  had not our hap been bad  with her lived in joy  our wealth increased by prosperous voyages often made to epidamnum  till my factor s death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse  from whom my absence was not six months old before herself  almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear  had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where was  there had she not been long  but she became joyful mother of two goodly sons  and  which was strange  the one so like the other  as could not be distinguish d but by names  that very hour  and in the self same inn  meaner woman was delivered of such a burden  male twins  both alike  those   for their parents were exceeding poor    bought and brought up to attend my sons  my wife  not meanly proud of two such boys  made daily motions for our home return  unwilling agreed  alas  too soon  we came aboard  league from epidamnum had we sail d  before the always wind obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm  but longer did we not retain much hope  for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds doubtful warrant of immediate death  which though myself would gladly have embraced  yet the incessant weepings of my wife  weeping before for what she saw must come  and piteous plainings of the pretty babes  that mourn d for fashion  ignorant what to fear  forced me to seek delays for them and me  and this it was  for other means was none  the sailors sought for safety by our boat  and left the ship  then sinking ripe  to us  my wife  more careful for the latter born  had fasten d him unto a small spare mast  such as seafaring men provide for storms  to him one of the other twins was bound  whilst had been like heedful of the other  the children thus disposed  my wife and fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix d  fasten d ourselves at either end the mast  and floating straight  obedient to the stream  was carried towards corinth  as we thought  at length the sun  gazing upon the earth  dispersed those vapours that offended us  and by the benefit of his wished light  the seas wax d calm  and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us  of corinth that  of epidaurus this  but ere they came   o  let me say no more  gather the sequel by that went before  nay  forward  old man  do not break off so  for we may pity  though not pardon thee  had the gods done so  had not now worthily term d them merciless to us  for  ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues  we were encounterd by a mighty rock  which being violently borne upon  our helpful ship was splitted in the midst  so that  in this unjust divorce of us  fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in  what to sorrow for  her part  poor soul  seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe  was carried with more speed before the wind  and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth  as we thought  at length  another ship had seized on us  and  knowing whom it was their hap to save  gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck d guests  and would have reft the fishers of their prey  had not their bark been very slow of sail  and therefore homeward did they bend their course  thus have you heard me sever d from my bliss  that by misfortunes was my life prolong d  to tell sad stories of my own mishaps  and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for  do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall n of them and thee till now  my youngest boy  and yet my eldest care  at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother  and importuned me that his attendant  so his case was like  reft of his brother  but retain d his

were so choleric  by what rule  sir  marry  sir  by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself  let s hear it  there s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature  may he not do it by fine and recovery  yes  to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man  why is time such a niggard of hair  being  as it is  so plentiful an excrement  because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts  and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit  why  but there s many a man hath more hair than wit  not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair  why  thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit  the plainer dealer  the sooner lost  yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity  for what reason  for two  and sound ones too  nay  not sound  pray you  sure ones  then  nay  not sure  in a thing falsing  certain ones then  name them  the one  to save the money that he spends in trimming  the other  that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge  you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things  marry  and did  sir  namely  no time to recover hair lost by nature  but your reason was not substantial  why there is no time to recover  thus mend it  time himself is bald and therefore to the world s end will have bald followers  knew  twould be a bald conclusion  but  soft  who wafts us
