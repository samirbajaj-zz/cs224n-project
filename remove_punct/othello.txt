your noble self  am sure  is sent for  how  the duke in council  in this time of the night  bring him away  mine s not an idle cause  the duke himself  or any of my brothers of the state  cannot but feel this wrong as  twere their own  for if such actions may have passage free  bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be  exeunt council chamber  the and senators sitting at a table  officers attending there is no composition in these news that gives them credit  first senator indeed  they are disproportion d  my letters say a hundred and seven galleys  and mine  a hundred and forty  second senator and mine  two hundred  but though they jump not on a just account    as in these cases  where the aim reports   tis oft with difference  yet do they all confirm turkish fleet  and bearing up to cyprus  nay  it is possible enough to judgment  do not so secure me in the error  but the main article do approve in fearful sense  sailor within what  ho  what  ho  what  ho  first officer messenger from the galleys  enter a sailor now  what s the business  sailor the turkish preparation makes for rhodes  so was bid report here to the state by signior angelo  how say you by this change  first senator this cannot be  by no assay of reason   tis a pageant  to keep us in false gaze  when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk  and let ourselves again but understand  that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes  so may he with more facile question bear it  for that it stands not in such warlike brace  but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress d in  if we make thought of this  we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first  neglecting an attempt of ease and gain  to wake and wage a danger profitless  nay  in all confidence  he s not for rhodes  first officer here is more news  enter a messenger messenger the ottomites  reverend and gracious  steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes  have there injointed them with an after fleet  first senator ay  so thought  how many  as you guess  messenger of thirty sail  and now they do restem their backward course  bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus  signior montano  your trusty and most valiant servitor  with his free duty recommends you thus  and prays you to believe him   tis certain  then  for cyprus  marcus luccicos  is not he in town  first senator he s now in florence  write from us to him  post post haste dispatch  first senator here comes brabantio and the valiant moor  enter and officers valiant othello  we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman  to did not see you  welcome  gentle signior  we lack d your counsel and your help tonight  so did yours  good your grace  pardon me  neither my place nor aught heard of business hath raised me from my bed  nor doth the general care take hold on me  for my particular grief is of so flood gate and o erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself  why  what s the matter  my daughter  my daughter  senator dead  ay  to me  she is abused  stol n from me  and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks  for nature so preposterously to err  being not deficient  blind  or lame of sense  sans witchcraft could not  whoe er he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her  the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense  yea  though our proper son stood in your action  humbly thank your grace  here is the man  this moor  whom now  it seems  your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought  senator we are very sorry for t  to what  in your own part  can you say to this  nothing  but this is so  most potent  grave  and reverend signiors  my very noble and approved good masters  that have ta en away this old man s daughter  it is most true  true  have married her  the very head and front of my offending hath this extent  no more  rude am in my speech  and little bless d with the soft phrase of peace  for since these arms of mine had seven years  pith  till now some nine moons wasted  they have used their dearest action in the tented field  and little of this great world can speak  more than pertains to feats of broil and battle  and therefore little shall grace my cause in speaking for myself  yet  by your gracious patience  will a round unvarnish d tale deliver of my whole course of love  what drugs  what charms  what conjuration and what mighty magic  for such proceeding am charged withal  won his daughter  maiden never bold  of spirit so still and quiet  that her motion blush d at herself  and she  in spite of nature  of years  of country  credit  every thing  to fall in love with what she fear d to look on  it is a judgment maim d and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature  and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell  why this should be  therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o er the blood  or with some dram conjured to this effect  he wrought upon her  to vouch this  is no proof  without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him  first senator but  othello  speak  did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid s affections  or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth  do beseech you  send for the lady to the sagittary  and let her speak of me before her father  if you do find me foul in her report  the trust  the office do hold of you  not only take away  but let your sentence even fall upon my life  fetch desdemona hither  ancient  conduct them  you best know the place  exeunt and attendants and  till she come  as truly as to heaven do confess the vices of my blood  so justly to your grave ears i ll present how did thrive in this fair lady s love  and she in mine  say it  othello  her father loved me  oft invited me  still question d me the story of my life  from year to year  the battles  sieges  fortunes  that have passed  ran it through  even from my boyish days  to the very moment that he bade me tell it  wherein spake of most disastrous chances  of moving accidents by flood and field of hair breadth scapes i  the imminent deadly breach  of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery  of my redemption thence and portance in my travels  history  wherein of antres vast and deserts idle  rough quarries  rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak   such was the process  and of the cannibals that each other eat  the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders  this to hear would desdemona seriously incline  but still the house affairs would draw her thence  which ever as she could with haste dispatch  she ld come again  and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse  which observing  took once a pliant hour  and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that would all my pilgrimage dilate  whereof by parcels she had something heard  but not intentively  did consent  and often did beguile her of her tears  when did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer d  my story being done  she gave me for my pains a world of sighs  she swore  in faith  twas strange   twas passing strange   twas pitiful   twas wondrous pitiful  she wish d she had not heard it  yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man  she thank d me  and bade me  if had a friend that loved her  should but teach him how to tell my story  and that would woo her  upon this hint spake  she loved me for the dangers had pass d  and loved her that she did pity them  this only is the witchcraft have used  here comes the lady  let her witness it  enter and attendants think this tale would win my daughter too  good brabantio  take up this mangled matter at the best  men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands  pray you  hear her speak  if she confess that she was half the wooer  destruction on my head  if my bad blame light on the man  come hither  gentle mistress  do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience  my noble father  do perceive here a divided duty  to you am bound for life and education  my life and education both do learn me how to respect you  you are the lord of duty  am hitherto your daughter  but here s my husband  and so much duty as my mother show d to you  preferring you before her father  so much challenge that may profess due to the moor my lord  god be wi  you  have done  please it your grace  on to the state affairs  had rather to adopt a child than get it  come hither  moor  here do give thee that with all my heart which  but thou hast already  with all my heart would keep from thee  for your sake  jewel  am glad at soul have no other child  for thy escape would teach me tyranny  to hang clogs on them  have done  my lord  let me speak like yourself  and lay a sentence  which  as a grise or step  may help these lovers into your favour  when remedies are past  the griefs are ended by seeing the worst  which late on hopes depended  to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on  what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes  the robb d that smiles steals something from the thief  he robs himself that spends a bootless grief  so let the turk of cyprus us beguile  we lose it not  so long as we can smile  he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears  but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that  to pay grief  must of poor patience borrow  these sentences  to sugar  or to gall  being strong on both sides  are equivocal  but words are words  never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear  humbly beseech you  proceed to the affairs of state  the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus  othello  the fortitude of the place is best known to you  and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency  yet opinion  a sovereign mistress of effects  throws a more safer voice on you  you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition  the tyrant custom  most grave senators  hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down  do agnise natural and prompt alacrity find in hardness  and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites  most humbly therefore bending to your state  crave fit disposition for my wife  due reference of place and exhibition  with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding  if you please  be t at her father s  i ll not have it so  nor nor would not there reside  to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye  most gracious duke  to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear  and let me find a charter in your voice  to assist my simpleness  what would you  desdemona  that did love the moor to live with him  my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world  my heart s subdued even to the very quality of my lord  saw othello s visage in his mind  and to his honour and his valiant parts did my soul and fortunes consecrate  so that  dear lords  if be left behind  moth of peace  and he go to the war  the rites for which love him are bereft me  and a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence  let me go with him  let her have your voices  vouch with me  heaven  therefore beg it not  to please the palate of my appetite  nor to comply with heat  the young affects in me defunct  and proper satisfaction  but to be free and bounteous to her mind  and heaven defend your good souls  that you think will your serious and great business scant for she is with me  no  when light wing d toys of feather d cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments  that my disports corrupt and taint my business  let housewives make a skillet of my helm  and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation  be it as you shall privately determine  either for her stay or going  the affair cries haste  and speed must answer it  first senator you must away to night  with all my heart  at nine i  the morning here we ll meet again  othello  leave some officer behind  and he shall our commission bring to you  with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you  so please your grace  my ancient  man he is of honest and trust  to his conveyance assign my wife  with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me  let it be so  good night to every one  to and  noble signior  if virtue no delighted beauty lack  your son in law is far more fair than black  first senator adieu  brave moor  use desdemona well  look to her  moor  if thou hast eyes to see  she has deceived her father  and may thee  exeunt senators  officers  &c my life upon her faith  honest iago  my desdemona must leave to thee  prithee  let thy wife attend on her  and bring them after in the best advantage  come  desdemona  have but an hour of love  of worldly matters and direction  to spend with thee  we must obey the time  exeunt and iago    what say st thou  noble heart  what will do  thinkest thou  why  go to bed  and sleep  will incontinently drown myself  if thou dost  shall never love thee after  why  thou silly gentleman  it is silliness to live when to live is torment  and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician  villainous  have looked upon the world for four times seven years  and since could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury  never found man that knew how to love himself  ere would say  would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen  would change my humanity with a baboon  what should do  confess it is my shame to be so fond  but it is not in my virtue to amend it  virtue  a fig   tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus  our bodies are our gardens  to the which our wills are gardeners  so that if we will plant nettles  or sow lettuce  set hyssop and weed up thyme  supply it with one gender of herbs  or distract it with many  either to have it sterile with idleness  or manured with industry  why  the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills  if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality  the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions  but we have reason to cool our raging motions  our carnal stings  our unbitted lusts  whereof take this that you call love to be a sect or scion  it cannot be  it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will  come  be a man  drown thyself  drown cats and blind puppies  have professed me thy friend and confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness  could never better stead thee than now  put money in thy purse  follow thou the wars  defeat thy favour with an usurped beard  say  put money in thy purse  it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor    put money in thy purse   nor he his to her  it was a violent commencement  and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration   put but money in thy purse  these moors are changeable in their wills  fill thy purse with money   the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts  shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida  she must change for youth  when she is sated with his body  she will find the error of her choice  she must have change  she must  therefore put money in thy purse  if thou wilt needs damn thyself  do it a more delicate way than drowning  make all the money thou canst  if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell  thou shalt enjoy her  therefore make money  pox of drowning thyself  it is clean out of the way  seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her  wilt thou be fast to my hopes  if depend on the issue  thou art sure of me   go  make money   i have told thee often  and re tell thee again and again  hate the moor  my cause is hearted  thine hath no less reason  let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him  if thou canst cuckold him  thou dost thyself a pleasure  me a sport  there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered  traverse  go  provide thy money  we will have more of this to morrow  adieu  where shall we meet i  the morning  at my lodging  i ll be with thee betimes  go to  farewell  do you hear  roderigo  what say you  no more of drowning  do you hear  am changed  i ll go sell all my land  exit thus do ever make my fool

me with what violence she first loved the moor  but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies  and will she love him still for prating  let not thy discreet heart think it  her eye must be fed  and what delight shall she have to look on the devil  when the blood is made dull with the act of sport  there should be  again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite  loveliness in favour  sympathy in years  manners and beauties  all which the moor is defective in  now  for want of these required conveniences  her delicate tenderness will find itself abused  begin to heave the gorge  disrelish and abhor the moor  very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice  now  sir  this granted   as it is a most pregnant and unforced position  who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does  a knave very voluble  no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming  for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection  why  none  why  none  a slipper and subtle knave  a finder of occasions  that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages  though true advantage never present itself  a devilish knave  besides  the knave is handsome  young  and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after  a pestilent complete knave  and the woman hath found him already  cannot believe that in her  she s full of most blessed condition  blessed fig s end  the wine she drinks is made of grapes  if she had been blessed  she would never have loved the moor  blessed pudding  didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand  didst not mark that  yes  that did  but that was but courtesy  lechery  by this hand  an index and obscure prologue to the history of

minister  well  sir  he is rash and very sudden in choler  and haply may strike at you  provoke him  that he may  for even out of that will cause these of cyprus to mutiny  whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio  so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means shall then have to prefer them  and the impediment most profitably removed  without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity  will do this  if can bring it to any opportunity  warrant thee  meet me by and by at the citadel  must fetch his necessaries ashore  farewell  adieu  exit that cassio loves her  do well believe it  that she loves him   tis apt and of great credit  the moor  howbeit that endure him not  is of a constant  loving  noble nature  and dare think he ll prove to desdemona most dear husband  now  do love her too  not out of absolute lust  though peradventure stand accountant for as great a sin  but partly led to diet my revenge  for that do suspect the lusty moor hath leap d into my seat  the thought whereof doth  like a poisonous mineral  gnaw my inwards  and nothing can or shall content my soul till am even d with him  wife

mouths of wisest censure  what s the matter  that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler  give me answer to it  worthy othello  am hurt to danger  your officer  iago  can inform you    while spare speech  which something now offends me    of all that do know  nor know aught by me that s said or done amiss this night  unless self charity be sometimes a vice  and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us  now  by heaven  my blood begins my safer guides to rule  and passion  having my best judgment collied  assays to lead the way  if once stir  or do but lift this arm  the best of you shall sink in my rebuke  give me to know how this foul rout began  who set it on  and he that is approved in this offence  though he had twinn d with me  both at a birth  shall lose me  what  in a town of war  yet wild  the people s hearts brimful of fear  to manage private and domestic quarrel  in night  and on the court and guard of safety   tis monstrous  iago  who began t  if partially affined  or leagued in office  thou dost deliver more or less than truth  thou art no soldier  touch me not so near  had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio  yet  persuade myself  to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him  thus it is  general  montano and myself being in speech  there comes a fellow crying out for help  and cassio following him with determined sword  to execute upon him  sir  this gentleman steps in to cassio  and entreats his pause  myself the crying fellow did pursue  lest by his clamour  as it so fell out   the town might fall in fright  he  swift of foot  outran my purpose  and return d the rather for that heard the clink and fall of swords  and cassio high in oath  which till to night ne er might say before  when came back   for this was brief  i found them close together  at blow and thrust  even as again they were when you yourself did part them  more of this matter cannot report  but men are men  the best sometimes forget  though cassio did some little wrong to him  as men in rage strike those that wish them best  yet surely cassio  believe  received from him that fled some strange indignity  which patience could not pass  know  iago  thy honesty and love doth mince this matter  making it light to cassio  cassio  love thee but never more be officer of mine  re enter attended look  if my gentle love be not raised up  i ll make thee an example  what s the matter  all s well now  sweeting  come away to bed  sir  for your hurts  myself will

slumbers waked with strife  exeunt all but and what  are you hurt  lieutenant  ay  past all surgery  marry  heaven forbid  reputation  reputation  reputation  have lost my reputation  have lost the immortal part of myself  and what remains is bestial  my reputation  iago  my reputation  as am an honest man  thought you had received some bodily wound  there is more sense in that than in reputation  reputation is an idle and most false imposition  oft got without merit  and lost without deserving  you have lost no reputation at all  unless you repute yourself such a loser  what  man  there are ways to recover the general again  you are but now cast in his mood  a punishment more in policy than in malice  even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion  sue to him again  and he s yours  will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight  so drunken  and so indiscreet an officer  drunk  and speak parrot  and squabble  swagger  swear  and discourse fustian with one s own shadow  thou invisible spirit of wine  if thou hast no name to be known by  let us call thee devil  what was he that you followed with your sword  what had he done to you  know not  is t possible  remember a mass of things  but nothing distinctly  a quarrel  but nothing wherefore  god  that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains  that we should  with joy  pleasance revel and applause  transform ourselves into beasts  why  but you are now well enough  how came you thus recovered  it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath  one unperfectness shows me another  to make me frankly despise myself  come  you are too severe a moraler  as the time  the place  and the condition of this country stands  could heartily wish this had not befallen  but  since it is as it is  mend it for your own good  will ask him for my place again  he shall tell me am a drunkard  had as many mouths as hydra  such an answer would stop them all  to be now a sensible man  by and by a fool  and presently a beast  strange  every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil  come  come  good wine is a good familiar creature  if it be well used  exclaim no more against it  and  good lieutenant  think you think love you  have well approved it  sir  drunk  you or any man living may be drunk  at a time  man  i ll tell you what you shall do  our general s wife is now the general  may say so in this respect  for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation  mark  and denotement of her parts and graces  confess yourself freely to her  importune her help to put you in your place again  she is of so free  so kind  so apt  so blessed a disposition  she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested  this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter  and  my fortunes against any lay worth naming  this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before  you advise me well  protest  in the sincerity of love and honest kindness  think it freely  and betimes in the morning will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me  am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here  you are in the right  good night  lieutenant  must to the watch  good night  honest iago  exit and what s he then that says play the villain  when this advice is free give and honest  probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again  for  tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit  she s framed as fruitful as the free elements  and then for her to win the moor  were t to renounce his baptism  all seals and symbols of redeemed sin  his soul is so enfetter d to her love  that she may make  unmake  do what she list  even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function  how am then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course  directly to his good  divinity of hell  when devils will the blackest sins put on  they do suggest at first with heavenly shows  as do now  for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor  i ll pour this pestilence into his ear  that she repeals him for her body s lust  and by how much she strives to do him good  she shall undo her credit with the moor  so will turn her virtue into pitch  and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all  re enter how now  roderigo  do follow here in the chase  not like a hound that hunts  but one that fills up the cry  my money is almost spent  have been to night exceedingly well cudgelled  and think the issue will be  shall have so much experience for my pains  and so  with no money at all and a little more

does t not go well  cassio hath beaten thee  and thou  by that small hurt  hast cashier d cassio  though other things grow fair against the sun  yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe  content thyself awhile  by the mass   tis morning  pleasure and action make the hours seem short  retire thee  go where thou art billeted  away  say  thou shalt know more hereafter  nay  get thee gone  exit two things are to be done  my wife must move for cassio to her mistress  i ll set her on  myself the while to draw the moor apart  and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife

wife are talking of it  and she speaks for you stoutly  the moor replies  that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus  and great affinity  and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you  but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again  yet  beseech you  if you think fit  or that it may be done  give me

days  in faith  he s penitent  and yet his trespass  in our common reason   save that  they say  the wars must make examples out of their best  is not almost a fault to incur a private cheque  when shall he come  tell me  othello  wonder in my soul  what you would ask me  that should deny  or stand so mammering on  what  michael cassio  that came a wooing with you  and so many a time  when have spoke of you dispraisingly  hath ta en your part  to have so much to do to bring him in  trust me  could do much    prithee  no more  let him come when he will  will deny thee nothing  why  this is not a boon   tis as should entreat you wear your gloves  or feed on nourishing dishes  or keep you warm  or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person  nay  when have a suit wherein mean to touch your love indeed  it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted  will deny thee nothing  whereon  do beseech thee  grant me this  to leave me but a little to myself  shall deny you  no  farewell  my lord  farewell  my desdemona  i ll come to thee straight  emilia  come  be as your fancies teach you  whate er you be  am obedient  exeunt and excellent wretch  perdition catch my soul  but do love thee  and when love thee not  chaos is come again  my noble lord   what dost thou say  iago  did michael cassio  when you woo d my lady  know of your love  he did  from first to last  why dost thou ask  but for a satisfaction of my thought  no further harm  why of thy thought  iago  did not think he had been acquainted with her  yes  and went between us very oft  indeed  indeed  ay  indeed  discern st thou aught in that  is he not honest  honest  my lord  honest  ay  honest  my lord  for aught know  what dost thou think  think  my lord  think  my lord  by heaven  he echoes me  as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown  thou dost mean something  heard thee say even now  thou likedst not that  when cassio left my wife  what didst not like  and when told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing  thou criedst  indeed   and didst contract and purse thy brow together  as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit  if thou dost love me  show me thy thought  my lord  you know love you  think thou dost  and  for know thou rt full of love and honesty  and weigh st thy words before thou givest them breath  therefore these stops of thine fright me the more  for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom  but in a man that s just they are close delations  working from the heart that passion cannot rule  for michael cassio  dare be sworn think that he is honest  think so too  men should be what they seem  or those that be not  would they might seem none  certain  men should be what they seem  why  then  think cassio s an honest man  nay  yet there s more in this  prithee  speak to me as to thy thinkings  as thou dost ruminate  and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words  good my lord  pardon me  though am bound to every act of duty  am not bound to that all slaves are free to  utter my thoughts  why  say they are vile and false  as where s that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not  who has a breast so pure  but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in session sit with meditations lawful  thou dost conspire against thy friend  iago  if thou but think st him wrong d and makest his ear stranger to thy thoughts  do beseech you   though perchance am vicious in my guess  as  confess  it is my nature s plague to spy into abuses  and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are not  that your wisdom yet  from one that so imperfectly conceits  would take no notice  nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance  it were not for your quiet nor your good  nor for my manhood  honesty  or wisdom  to let you know my thoughts  what dost thou mean  good name in man and woman  dear my lord  is the immediate jewel of their souls  who steals my purse steals trash   tis something  nothing   twas mine   tis his  and has been slave to thousands  but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed  by heaven  i ll know thy thoughts  you cannot  if my heart were in your hand  nor shall not  whilst  tis in my custody  ha  beware  my lord  of jealousy  it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on  that cuckold lives in bliss who  certain of his fate  loves not his wronger  but  what damned minutes tells he o er who dotes  yet doubts  suspects  yet strongly loves  misery  poor and content is rich and rich enough  but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor  good heaven  the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy  why  why is this  think st thou i ld make a lie of jealousy  to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions  no  to be once in doubt is once to be resolved  exchange me for a goat  when shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises  matching thy inference   tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair  feeds well  loves company  is free of speech  sings  plays and dances well  where virtue is  these are more virtuous  nor from mine own weak merits will draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt  for she had eyes  and chose me  no  iago  i ll see before doubt  when doubt  prove  and on the proof  there is no more but this    away at once with love or jealousy  am glad of it  for now shall have reason to show the love and duty that bear you with franker spirit  therefore  as am bound  receive it from me  speak not yet of proof  look to your wife  observe her well with cassio  wear your eye thus  not jealous nor secure  would not have your free and noble nature  out of self bounty  be abused  look to t  know our country disposition well  in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands  their best conscience is not to leave t undone  but keep t unknown  dost thou say so  she did deceive her father  marrying you  and when she seem d to shake and fear your looks  she loved them most  and so she did  why  go to then  she that  so young  could give out such a seeming  to seal her father s eyes up close as oak  he thought  twas witchcraft  but am much to blame  humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you  am bound to thee for ever  see this hath a little dash d your spirits  not a jot  not a jot  i  faith  fear it has  hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love  but do see you re moved  am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion  will not  should you do so  my lord  my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at  cassio s my worthy friend   my lord  see you re moved  no  not much moved  do not think but desdemona s honest  long live she so  and long live you to think so  and yet  how nature erring from itself    ay  there s the point  as  to be bold with you   not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime  complexion  and degree  whereto we see in all things nature tends   foh  one may smell in such a will most rank  foul disproportion thoughts unnatural  but pardon me  do not in position distinctly speak of her  though may fear her will  recoiling to her better judgment  may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent  farewell  farewell  if more thou dost perceive  let me know more  set on thy wife to observe  leave me  iago  going my lord  take my leave  why did marry  this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more  much more  than he unfolds  returning my lord  would might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further  leave it to time  though it be fit that cassio have his place  for sure  he fills it up with great ability  yet  if you please to hold him off awhile  you shall by that perceive him and his means  note  if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity  much will be seen in that  in the mean time  let me be thought too busy in my fears   as worthy cause have to fear am   and hold her free  do beseech your honour  fear not my government  once more take my leave  exit this fellow s of exceeding honesty  and knows all qualities  with a learned spirit  of human dealings  if do prove her haggard  though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings  i ld whistle her off and let her down the wind  to pray at fortune  haply  for am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have  or for am declined into the vale of years   yet that s not much   she s gone  am abused  and my relief must be to loathe her  curse of marriage  that we can call these delicate creatures ours  and not their appetites  had rather be a toad  and live upon the vapour of a dungeon  than keep a corner in the thing love for others  uses  yet   tis the plague of great ones  prerogatived are they less than the base   tis destiny unshunnable  like death  even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken  desdemona comes  re

of soul  that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs  one of this kind is cassio  in sleep heard him say  sweet desdemona  let us be wary  let us hide our loves   and then  sir  would he gripe and wring my hand  cry  o sweet creature   and then kiss me hard  as if he pluck d up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips  then laid his leg over my thigh  and sigh d  and kiss d  and then cried  cursed fate that gave thee to the moor   monstrous  monstrous  nay  this was but his dream  but this denoted a foregone conclusion   tis a shrewd doubt  though it be but a dream  and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly  i ll tear her all to pieces  nay  but be wise  yet we see nothing done  she may be honest yet  tell me but this  have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife s hand  gave her such a one   twas my first gift  know not that  but such a handkerchief   am sure it was your wife s  did to day see cassio wipe

this  clown know not where he lodges  and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there  were to lie in mine own throat  can you inquire him out  and be edified by report  clown will catechise the world for him  that is  make questions  and by them answer  seek him  bid him come hither  tell him have moved my lord on his behalf  and hope all will be well  clown to do this is within the compass of man s wit  and therefore will attempt the doing it  exit where should lose that handkerchief  emilia  know not  madam  believe me  had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes  and  but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are  it were enough to put him to ill thinking  is he not jealous  who  he  think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him  look  where he comes  will not leave him now till cassio be call d to him  enter how is t with you  my lord well  my good lady  aside hardness to dissemble    how do you  desdemona  well  my good lord  give me your hand  this hand is moist  my lady  it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow  this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart  hot  hot  and moist  this hand of yours requires sequester from liberty  fasting and prayer  much castigation  exercise devout  for here s a young and sweating devil here  that commonly rebels   tis a good hand  frank one  you may  indeed  say so  for  twas that hand that gave away my heart  liberal hand  the hearts of old gave hands  but our new heraldry is hands  not hearts  cannot speak of this  come now  your promise  what promise  chuck  have sent to bid cassio come speak with you  have a salt and sorry rheum offends me  lend me thy handkerchief  here  my lord  that which gave you  have it not about me  not  no  indeed  my lord  that is a fault  that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give  she was a charmer  and could almost read the thoughts of people  she told her  while she kept it   twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love  but if she lost it or made gift of it  my father s eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies  she  dying  gave it me  and bid me  when my fate would have me wive  to give it her  did so  and take heed on t  make it a darling like your precious eye  to lose t or give t away were such perdition as nothing else

other way   tis she must do t  and  lo  the happiness  go  and importune her  how now  good cassio  what s the news with you  madam  my former suit  do beseech you that by your virtuous means may again exist  and be a member of his love whom with all the office of my heart entirely honour  would not be delay d  if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past  nor present sorrows  nor purposed merit in futurity  can ransom me into his love again  but to know so must be my benefit  so shall clothe me in a forced content  and shut myself up in some other course  to fortune s alms  alas  thrice gentle cassio  my advocation is not now in tune  my lord is not my lord  nor should know him  were he in favour as in humour alter d  so help me every spirit sanctified  as have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech  you must awhile be patient  what can do will  and more will than for myself dare  let that suffice you  is my lord
