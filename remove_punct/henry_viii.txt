sent down among  em  which hath flaw d the heart of all their loyalties  wherein  although  my good lord cardinal  they vent reproaches most bitterly on you  as putter on of these exactions  yet the king our master   whose honour heaven shield from soil   even he escapes not language unmannerly  yea  such which breaks the sides of loyalty  and almost appears in loud rebellion  not almost appears  it doth appear  for  upon these taxations  the clothiers all  not able to maintain the many to them longing  have put off the spinsters  carders  fullers  weavers  who  unfit for other life  compell d by hunger and lack of other means  in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth  are all in uproar  and danger serves among then  taxation  wherein  and what taxation  my lord cardinal  you that are blamed for it alike with us  know you of this taxation  please you  sir  know but of a single part  in aught pertains to the state  and front but in that file where others tell steps with me  no  my lord  you know no more than others  but you frame things that are known alike  which are not wholesome to those which would not know them  and yet must perforce be their acquaintance  these exactions  whereof my sovereign would have note  they are most pestilent to the bearing  and  to bear  em  the back is sacrifice to the load  they say they are devised by you  or else you suffer too hard an exclamation  still exaction  the nature of it  in what kind  let s know  is this exaction  am much too venturous in tempting of your patience  but am bolden d under your promised pardon  the subjects  grief comes through commissions  which compel from each the sixth part of his substance  to be levied without delay  and the pretence for this is named  your wars in france  this makes bold mouths  tongues spit their duties out  and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them  their curses now live where their prayers did  and it s come to pass  this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will  would your highness would give it quick consideration  for there is no primer business  by my life  this is against our pleasure  and for me  have no further gone in this than by single voice  and that not pass d me but by learned approbation of the judges  if am traduced by ignorant tongues  which neither know my faculties nor person  yet will be the chronicles of my doing  let me say  tis but the fate of place  and the rough brake that virtue must go through  we must not stint our necessary actions  in the fear to cope malicious censurers  which ever  as ravenous fishes  do a vessel follow that is new trimm d  but benefit no further than vainly longing  what we oft do best  by sick interpreters  once weak ones  is not ours  or not allow d  what worst  as oft  hitting a grosser quality  is cried up for our best act  if we shall stand still  in fear our motion will be mock d or carp d at  we should take root here where we sit  or sit state statues only  things done

feel too little  hear too much  stand forth  and with bold spirit relate what you  most like a careful subject  have collected out of the duke of buckingham  speak freely  surveyor first  it was usual with him  every day it would infect his speech  that if the king should without issue die  he ll carry it so to make the sceptre his  these very words i ve heard him utter to his son in law  lord abergavenny  to whom by oath he menaced revenge upon the cardinal  please your highness  note this dangerous conception in this point  not friended by by his wish  to your high person his will is most malignant  and it stretches beyond you  to your friends  my learn d lord cardinal  deliver all with charity  speak on  how grounded he his title to the crown  upon our fail  to this point hast thou heard him at any time speak aught  surveyor he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins  what was that hopkins  surveyor sir  a chartreux friar  his confessor  who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty  how know st thou this  surveyor not long before your highness sped to france  the duke being at the rose  within the parish saint lawrence poultney  did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey  replied  men fear d the french would prove perfidious  to the king s danger  presently the duke said   twas the fear  indeed  and that he doubted  twould prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk   that oft   says he   hath sent to me  wishing me to permit john de la car  my chaplain  a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment  whom after under the confession s seal he solemnly had sworn  that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living  but to me  should utter  with demure confidence this pausingly ensued  neither the king nor s heirs  tell you the duke  shall prosper  bid him strive to gain the love o  the commonalty  the duke shall govern england   if know you well  you were the duke

until it forged him some design  which  being believed  it was much like to do  he answer d   tush  it can do me no damage   adding further  that  had the king in his last sickness fail d  the

were you there  first gentleman yes  indeed  was second gentleman pray  speak what has happen d  first gentleman you may guess quickly what  second gentleman is he found guilty  first gentleman yes  truly is he  and condemn d upon t  second gentleman am sorry for t  first gentleman so are a number more  second gentleman but  pray  how pass d it  first gentleman i ll tell you in a little  the great duke came to the bar  where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law  the king s attorney on the contrary urged on the examinations  proofs  confessions of divers witnesses  which the duke desired to have brought viva voce to his face  at which appear d against him his surveyor  sir gilbert peck his chancellor  and john car  confessor to him  with that devil monk  hopkins  that made this mischief  second gentleman that was he that fed him with his prophecies  first gentleman the same  all these accused him strongly  which he fain would have flung from him  but  indeed  he could not  and so his peers  upon this evidence  have found him guilty of high treason  much he spoke  and learnedly  for life  but all was either pitied in him or forgotten  second gentleman after all this  how did he bear himself  first gentleman when he was brought again to the bar  to hear his knell rung out  his judgment  he was stirr d with such an agony  he sweat extremely  and something spoke in choler  ill  and hasty  but he fell to himself again  and sweetly in all the rest show d a most noble patience  second gentleman do not think he fears death  first gentleman sure  he does not  he never was so womanish  the cause he may a little grieve at  second gentleman certainly the cardinal is the end of this  first gentleman  tis likely  by all

cardinal  do excuse you  yea  upon mine honour  free you from t  you are not to be taught that you have many enemies  that know not why they are so  but  like to village curs  bark when their fellows

d  oft  the passages made toward it  on my honour  speak my good lord cardinal to this point  and thus far clear him  now  what moved me to t  will be bold with time and your attention  then mark the inducement  thus it came  give heed to t  my conscience first received a tenderness  scruple  and prick  on certain speeches utter d by the bishop of bayonne  then french ambassador  who had been hither sent on the debating marriage  twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary  i  the progress of this business  ere a determinate resolution  he  mean the bishop  did require a respite  wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate  respecting this our marriage with the dowager  sometimes our brother s wife  this respite shook the bosom of my conscience  enter d me  yea  with a splitting power  and made to tremble the region of my breast  which forced such way  that many mazed considerings did throng and press d in with this caution  first  methought stood not in the smile of heaven  who had commanded nature  that my lady s womb  if it conceived a male child by me  should do no more offices of life to t than the grave does to the dead  for her male issue or died where they were made  or shortly after this world had air d them  hence took a thought  this was a judgment on me  that my kingdom  well worthy the best heir o  the world  should not be gladded in t by me  then follows  that weigh d the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue s fail  and that gave to me many a groaning throe  thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience  did steer toward this remedy  whereupon we are now present here together  that s to say  meant to rectify my conscience   which then did feel full sick  and yet not well    by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn d  first began in private with you  my lord of lincoln  you remember how under my oppression did reek  when first moved you  very well  my liege  have spoke long  be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me  so please your highness  the question did at first so stagger me  bearing a state of mighty moment in t and consequence of dread  that committed the daring st counsel which had to doubt  and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running here  then moved you  my lord of canterbury  and got your leave to make this present summons  unsolicited left no reverend person in this court  but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals  therefore  go on  for no dislike i  the world against the person of the good queen  but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons  drive this forward  prove but our marriage lawful  by my life and kingly dignity  we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her  katharine our queen  before the primest creature that s paragon d o  the world  so please your highness  the queen being absent   tis a needful fitness that we adjourn this court till further day  meanwhile must be an earnest motion made to the queen  to call back her appeal she intends unto his holiness  aside may perceive these cardinals trifle with me  abhor this dilatory sloth

have mercy on the fault thou gavest him  whilst your great goodness  out of holy pity  absolved him with an axe  this  and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit  answer is most false  the duke by law found his deserts  how innocent was from any private malice in his end  his noble jury and foul cause can witness  if loved many words  lord  should tell you you have as little honesty as

scarlet  farewell nobility  let his grace go forward  and dare us with his cap like larks  all goodness is poison to thy stomach  yes  that goodness of gleaning all the land s wealth into one  into your own hands  cardinal  by extortion  the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to the pope against the king  your goodness  since you provoke me  shall be most notorious  my lord of norfolk  as you are truly noble  as you respect the common good  the state of our despised nobility  our issues  who  if he live  will scarce be gentlemen  produce the grand sum of his sins  the articles collected from his life  i ll startle you worse than the scaring bell  when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms  lord cardinal  how much  methinks  could despise this man  but that am bound in charity against it  those articles  my lord  are in the king s hand  but  thus much  they are foul ones  so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise  when the king knows my truth  this cannot save you  thank my memory  yet remember some of these articles  and out they shall  now  if you can blush and cry  guilty   cardinal  you ll show a little honesty  speak on  sir  dare your worst objections  if blush  it is to see a nobleman want manners  had rather want those than my head  have at you  first  that  without the king s assent or knowledge  you wrought to be a legate  by which power you maim d the jurisdiction of all bishops  then  that in all you writ to rome  or else to foreign princes   ego et rex meus  was still inscribed  in which you brought the king to be your servant  then that  without the knowledge either of king or council  when you went ambassador to the emperor  you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal  item  you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado  to conclude  without the king s will or the state s allowance  league between his highness and ferrara  that  out of mere ambition  you have caused your holy hat to be stamp d on the king s coin  then that you have sent innumerable substance   by what means got  leave to your own conscience   to furnish rome  and to prepare the ways you have for dignities  to the mere undoing of all the kingdom  many more there are  which  since they are of you  and odious  will not taint my mouth with  chamberlain my lord  press not a falling man too far   tis virtue  his faults lie open to the laws  let them  not you  correct him  my heart weeps to see him so little of his great self  forgive him  lord cardinal  the king s further pleasure is  because all those things you have done of late  by your power legatine  within this kingdom  fall into the compass of a praemunire  that therefore such a writ be sued against you  to forfeit all your goods  lands  tenements  chattels  and whatsoever  and to be out of the king s protection  this is my charge  and so we ll leave you to your meditations how to live better  for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us  the king shall know it  and  no doubt  shall thank you  so fare you well  my little good lord cardinal  exeunt all but so farewell to the little good you bear me  farewell  a long farewell  to all my greatness  this is the state of man  to day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes  to morrow blossoms  and bears his blushing honours thick upon him  the third day comes a frost  a killing frost  and  when he thinks  good easy man  full surely his greatness is a ripening  nips his root  and then he falls  as do  have ventured  like little wanton boys that swim on bladders  this many summers in a sea of glory  but far beyond my depth  my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me  weary and old with service  to the mercy of a rude stream  that must for ever hide me  vain pomp and glory of this world  hate ye  feel my heart new open d  how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes  favours  there is  betwixt that smile we would aspire to  that sweet aspect of princes  and their ruin  more pangs and fears than wars or women have  and when he falls  he falls like lucifer  never to hope again  enter and stands amazed why  how now  cromwell  have no power

it  hope have  am able now  methinks  out of a fortitude of soul feel  to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer  what news abroad  the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king  god bless him  the next is  that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place  that s somewhat sudden  but he s a learned man  may he continue long in his highness  favour  and do justice for truth s sake and his conscience  that his bones  when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings  may have a tomb of orphans  tears wept on em  what more  that

master  seek the king  that sun  pray  may never set  have told him what and how true thou art  he will advance thee  some little memory of me will stir him   know his noble nature  not to let thy hopeful service perish too  good cromwell  neglect him not  make use now  and provide for thine own future safety  my lord  must then  leave you  must needs forego so good  so noble and so true a master  bear witness  all that have not hearts of iron  with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord  the king shall have my service  but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours  cromwell  did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries  but thou hast forced me  out of thy honest truth  to play the woman  let s dry our eyes  and thus far hear me  cromwell  and  when am forgotten  as shall be  and sleep in dull cold marble  where no mention of me more must be heard of  say  taught thee  say  wolsey  that once trod the ways of glory  and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour  found

angels  how can man  then  the image of his maker  hope to win by it  love thyself last  cherish those hearts that hate thee  corruption wins not more than honesty  still in thy right hand carry gentle peace  to silence envious tongues  be just  and fear not  let all the ends thou aim st at be thy country s  thy god s  and truth s  then if thou fall st  cromwell  thou fall st a blessed martyr
