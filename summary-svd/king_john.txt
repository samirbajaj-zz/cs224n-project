For England, cousin, go: Hubert shall be your man, attend on you With all true duty. An if an angel should have come to me And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes, would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's. Enter English Herald, with trumpet English Herald Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells: King John, your king and England's doth approach, Commander of this hot malicious day: Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright, Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood; There stuck no plume in any English crest That is removed by a staff of France; Our colours do return in those same hands That did display them when we first march'd forth; And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come Our lusty English, all with purpled hands, Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes: Open your gates and gives the victors way.
